ig to be $2.00 on dogsa“and $4,00 on
bitches, and municipalities will have
the right to increase the amount by
by-law. Mr. Ellfott, tha-Eiberal mem-
ber for West, Middlesex;/thought there
should be some limit of the maximum
tax or exceasive taxation Might defeat
the end In view.

A further $1,000,000 has been set
aside to ald in the improvement of
public highways, Th Minister of
Public Works announced in the Legis-
lature. that approximately * $3,000,000
had already been spent /by the Ontsrio
Government upon the cgnstruction and
improvement of county roads through-
out.the Province.

Peat apparently cannot be depended
on as a substitute for coal next wip-
ter, according to the replies of the On-
tario Government toa. deputation
| which interviewed them on. the sub-
jeet during the past week. The Min-
ister of Lands, Forest and Mines, how- |
ever, announced that any municipality

willing to undertake the cutting of
trees in Algonquin Park under the
| supervision of Governwbent © officials,
| might have the wood free for distribu-
| tion at the cost of cutting. There is
a provision of $100,000 in the estim-
ates, which will be expénded in anin-
| vestigation into the source of the fuel
aupply in the Province; with a view
to remedying present conditions,

Sharp criticism for the Opposition
benches characterized the debate on
the Government's Civil) Service meas-
ume. The Liberals coulfl not see that
ansy great advance was being made
undier the bill in the abolition of pat-
romage, The Liberal Leader, Mr.
Proudfoot, objected. fhat decisions
maile by the Civil Servig¢e Commiss{on-
er could be overridden by the Govern-
memt. - He thought the’ Commissioner |
shawld have a free han, and appoint-
Mmemts should be mad@~-through him |
‘after full investigation) by him: as to}

he; merits of the case. Mr. Elliott,

‘Mr:. Dewart and Mr. Carter, on ,the|
Lilveral side took the game stand, but|

SOME HEN, THIS!

 

 

 

Chatham has a hen which is setting
a record in egg laying. Since the first
of the year she has laid two eggs a
day for the majority of the days, and.
has never missed laying at least one
egg. Her record fs three-eggs im six
hours. An expert poultry man was in
Chatham trying to’ purchase the hen.
and when he could not, he paid $30 for
six eggs. An effort is\ being made to
find a good mate for this hen, as she
has beaten records.of the best layers
at the Ontario Agricultural College. J.

FORMALIN TREATMENT
PREVENTS OAT SMUT

 

 

 

Formaldehyde is the *common ma-
terial used to treat oats.for prevention
of smet A pint of 40-per cent. formal-
dehyde, known commercially as for.
malin, to 40 gallons of water will treat
40 to 45 bushels of grain.

A sprinkling can is convenient to
moisten the oats spread ont on a light
floor or canvas. By shovelling ver the
grain the entire mass can be thorough-
ly moistened with the solution. The
heap is then covered with a blanket
for. about three or four hours or over
night and later spread to-dry.

The Ohio Experiment Station rec-

ommends the Hberal use of formalin |

to prevent oat smut, as the treatment
hes caused material increases in crop
ylelds. It cautions farmers to nse the
same solution freely to disinfect bags
and ‘drills used in seeding the oata.

BY-LAW No. ----

A By-Law to provide for Drainage Work in the Township of Colchesté* South, in the
County of Eesex, and for borrowing on the credit of the Municipality the eum of
Four Hundred and Nineteen Dollars and Thirty Cente for completing the same.
Provisionally. adopted the 4th day of February, A. D. 1913.

Whereas the majority in numbef of the lent and non-resident owners (exclusive
of farmers’ sons not actual owners), a3 sho by the last revised Assessment Roll, of
the property hereinafter set forth to be beneftted by drainage work, that is 40 say,
by constructing. a tile drain along Queen Street in the Village of Harrow, have petition-
ed the Council of the said Township ofGolehester South praying that the lands on the
East side of Queen Street in the Villagé of Harrow, from Munger Avenue to’ the Philip
Férriss Drain, may be drained by means of a Tile Drain. :

And whereas, thereupon the said Council has procuréd an examination to be made
by J.J. Newman, being a person competent for such purpose, of the said area pro-
hed to be drained, and the means suggested for the drainage thereof, and of other
ands and roads }iible to assessment undor the monte eal Drainage Act, and has also
procured plans, specifications and estimates of {he drainage work to be made by the
sald J. J, Newman. aiid al assessment to be made by him of tho Jands and roads %o bo
beneNtted by such drainage work, and of othor lands and roads Meble tor cvntribution
thereto, stating a8 nearly as he can the propose n of Denent, outlet Mability and injur-
ing lability which, in his opinion, will be derived or incurred in consequonco. of such
drainage work by every road and lot, or portion of lot, the said assessment so made
Deing the assessment hereinafter by this by-law enacted to be assessed and levied upon
the roads and. lots, or parts of lots, hereinafter in that behalf specially set forth and
flescribed; and the report of the satd-J. J, Newman in respect thereof, and ofthe said

drainage work being as follows:—
e Windsor, Ont., October 20th, 1917,

To the Reeve and Municipal Council of the Township of Colchester South:—
Gentlemen,—In compliance with your instructions, I haye made an examination,

survey, report, etc., of the®.drain petitioned for by Thomas Vincent and others, and now

report theron as follows: {
I commenced my survey at the Phill

> Ferriss Drain on the East side of Queen Street.
Thence I followed along the East side of

Queen Street to the Northerly side of Munger
Avenue, in the Police Village of Harrow.

I find that there 18 at present a 12* tile drain from tho ae
noint about 722.feet south thereof at the catch basin near the line be
Gordon Arnerand W, H. Ferriss. From the last mentioned point to the Southerly side
of Sinasao Avenuo there has been a 7" tWHeedraim constructed, but thrs Iass mentioned
drain 18 80 shallow, and so poorly Jaid that it in fact, is of very little DeneNt.to tho
lands it wi tended to drain, and a8 @ consequence the Jands South of the Pere Mar-
quotte Railway are nooded with every small freshet that comes.

In order to’ overcome this dimculty, and. thus afford proper drainage to tho lands
and roads affected, | would recommend that a 12“ tile drain be constructed from the
catch basin near the line between the lands of Gordbn Arner and W. H:.Ferriss té the
catch basin at the Southerly -alde of Sinasac Avenue, and a 7** tile drain be constructed
from the Jast mentioned point to the northerly sldé of Munger avenue; sll 68 shown on
the accompanying profile and) specifications.

J further find that (t will be necessary to construct a drain ander tho tracks ef
the’Pere Marquette Railroad with 12" sewer. crock laid in concrete, a8 shown on the
accompanying pronie. . 7

Lostimate the cost of construct}iig this portion of the drain at the sum of $150.00,
1 estimate the cost of constructing 12" fa tile drain for the same distance at the
sum of $13:80, Making a difference in cost, the sum of $136.20. This last mentioned
amount I have assessed against the Pere Marquette Ratiroad Company to be borne and
contrbuted by 18 in case it does not exercise its option of constructing the Said drain
within @ reasonable time and. without unnecesséry delay. 2 3

Should the Natlway Company construct the drain under tho tracks above men-
toned, then the Zownship, wil pry, to the said Lompany the sum of $43.80.

my estimate of the cost of the whole of the above work, together with all inei-
dental-expenses, except the Pere:Marquette Rallrosd crossing, 18 tne sum of $419.30,
Of this amount 1 have assessed the lands which.are’ benefitted by or use the sald drain
aS an’ outlet, with the sum of $286.00, and the aD of. Colchester South for roads
with tho sum of $133.30, as is more fully set forth in the schedulo of assessment.
hereto attached. ¢

I would*further recommend that this drainage work be kept w and maintained at
the expense of the lands and roadsherein assessed for its construct! ion, end In the pro-
portion herein-contained until otherwise determined by the report of an engineer undér
the provisions of the MunicitpalDrainage Act. é bs

Accompanying this report you will find. a copy of this report, plans atid specinca?
tions for the purpose of securing the approval of the Railway Commission, shiuld it be
round Necessary {0 secure such spproval before the Pere Marquette Railway will con-
Struct the drain ufider their tracks. . .

All af which 18 respectfully submitted.

Abnormal conditions and issues: pro-
duced some very peculiar results, em-
phasizing the queer 4mix-up in. repre-
sentation and parties in the new Par-
liament. A net Gdvernment majority
of sixty-eight, so far, with the Yukon

history of Confederation. Civilian ma-
jorities of upwards of a thousand for
Opposition candidates have been turn-'
ed into’ majorities for the Government
enndidates -by the soldiers’ votes. In
Nipissing, for “instance, whore the
civilian vote gave Lapierre a major-
