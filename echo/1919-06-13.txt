ay
Senate Believed Ready to Kill Exten-
sion. Measure.

According to an Ottawa despatch
the bil which  rebeptly. passed the
House of CommonsieXtending the or- |
der-in-Council for nation-wide sprohi-
bition until a year after the war will
be thrown out by the Senate.

This would not prevent any provin-
cial Legislature prohabiting the Impor-
tution of liquor, but it would permit
considerable stocking up before such
legislation could® be passed. i

Should the Senate-reject™ the bill
then’ jmportation® from the. United
States.up to July Ist and from Britaig
ani“ other countries by private per
“sons would be, legal. And perhaps
Quebéc will bive a dispensary sale

io a sudden stop at 10 a’clock Satur-
day night, when motormen and con-

increased wages. The ction ‘was
taken on the recommendation of W.
H. Mahon, president of tae Ama:ga-

Rajlway Employees, who wis inform:
ed by President Frank W. Brooke, of
the traction company, that a higher
schedule of fares, on which increased
pay for the men was contingent, had
been refused by the city. council.

Following the vote the carman were
»instructed to take their cars to the
barns immediately, leaving hundreds
of Saturday night theatre crowds dad
shoppers marooned in the downtown
district, 1t having previously been ab-
mounced the “strike, if called; would

Weak, Pale People Require a
Blood-making Medicine.

It took centuries for medical se!-
ence to discover that the blood is the
life. Now, it js known that if the
blood were always abundant, rich
and pure, very few persons would
ever be ill, -It was not until the end
of the 19th century that an instru-
ment was invented for measuring the
red part of the blood. Then doctors
could tell just how anaemic a patient
had become, and with medicine to
make new blood the patient soon got
well.

All the blood in the body Js nour-
ished and kept rich and red by the
food taken daily, but when, for any
reason, @ person is run down and
cannot make sufficient. blood from:
the food to keep the body in health,
then a blood-making medicine {s re-
quired, The simplest and very best

Tobacco is naturally a self-fertiiiza

the earliest flowers which form, and
the plant-food which would be dis-

the development of the earlier pods.
The seed head should then be covered
with a fourteen-pound manilla bag, the
mouth of which is tied loosely around
the stalk just below the lowest re-
maining branches. About every two
wepks thesé bags should be removed,
alf suckers and late pods broken off,
and the bags replaced. After all of
the seed pods have formed, the bags
should be removed and the pods al-
lowed to ripen in the open. This will
cause the seed to ripen earlier and
give a better germination test.

Women Show: Partiality to Fab-
rics That Are More Suitable
to the Season.

SILK JERSEY IN LIMELIGHT

Popular Demand Will Be Met and In-
dications Are That the Mate-
rial May Be Substituted

New York.—The world seems to
have made up Its mind to wear in sum-
mer the clothes that are suggestive of
summer.

This may sound like a familiar con-
dition to women in those sectors of
the country that prepare for the heat
In April and do not think of warm
clothes until November; but in -the
large majority of these United States,
observes a farbion writer, there has
been a tendency to dress in summer
in a way that scems to defy the cnl-

‘

Foulard) frock, with petticoat and
plaited ruffics of taffeta.

Hundreds of these women buy
thin serge frocks nnd ‘sults, gowns
with .strong silk*Hnings~* chiffon or
satin bodices that do not wash, and
there is always n bit of fur hanging
In the closet rendy to be used with
or without excuse

There was a ~t.me when even the
women-of the cooler states pemnitted
themselves to look upon Ingerle
gowns with favor. This was done In
Paris, where there hos always been uo
tendency to avold cool simplicity, even
though July «und August demand
clothes that will give eomfort. The
nvérage Parigavoman, even though she
may be a young girl working for her
living, never appears in the street or
at a shop in a separate white’ shirt-
waist without a coat, and none of the
Paris women go about the streets in
muslin or linen frocks. Jt was’ this
French custom in summer clothes that
governed the American output for the
last decade or so, }

fabric 1s still used, bit the henvy allk
wenve, plain or fancful, is doing its
best to come/in ahewd of the others
on the race ‘track, of fashiona. The
‘American mills: haye turned out this
French product with more or less
success. There is the drop-stitch
kind, another weave that has a thick

that has a twisted and a plain con-
trasting design.

This fabric has taken unto Itself the
alr of a conqueror, for it ‘aspires to a
formal place in sorlety, It appears in
the guise of an evening gown, not for
formal occasions, it is, true, but for
dimer at a restaurant and the theater

makers In the same way as satin. It
has long lace sleeves, sometimes a hip-
senrf of Spanish Ince with a deep,
pendant panel in front; again, it has
an upper bodice of white chiffon with
square Spanish sleeves to match, It Js
used for coat sults and offers itself as
n riyal to Shantung, for [t does not
wrinkle easily. It comes in the ma-
Jority of good colors, and In beige und

It is felt, more than. sald, that eatin
may have had {ts day as a spring fab-
ric. There js a strong tendency nway

Ps
(Contributed by Onturto Department or
Agriculture, Toronto.)

OR the farmer who ifs raising
hogs, one ofthe greatest
problems [8 summer pasture.
A new luxuriant growth of

green grass is soon eaten off when
the dry hot season comes and it is
just at this time when the stockman
needs some form of succulent feed
for his stock, When the stock gre
running on pasture they are getting
back to nature and there is nothing
I{ke good green feed as a conditioner
for the animals. i

As for forage crops in this coun-

try alfalfa and rape seem to give the
best results, although anything that
will produce a good green growth in
a dry season is all right. Wherever
alfalfa will grow it gives the best
kind of permanent pasture. for pigs,
as there is no danger from bloat as
is the case of sheep and’ cattle.
Alfalfa provides pasture for a great-
er length of time than any of the
grasses and {s green and succulent
even when red clover has become
somewhat dried and woody. '

Heavy pasturing of alfalfa is not
good for it and consequently the
number of animals allowed to pas-
ture on it should be restricted and
the plants should be allowed to grow
up and be cut two on three times q
season. Pigs, fed corn alone on al-
falfa pasture, make falrly satisfac-
tory gains since the protein in the
alfalfa helps to balance up the de
ficiences in cofn, although for best
results a little of some nitrogenous
concentrates should be fed. Red
clover in the country gives very ex-
cellent results as a pasture for pigs,
for the reason that it can be grown
in a great many localities where
alfalfa cannot- be raised at all and
consequently it’s great value. At one
of the Experimental Stations in the
States, red clover was inferior only
to alfalfa, while at another it -was
found that it was surpassed only.by
alfalfa and rape.

As an annual pasture for swine
nothing surpasses rape. It can be
sowm both early and late in the sea-
son and as a consequence forage may
be provided for at any time. To get
the best results from rape, {it should
be sown in the spring and allowed
to obtain a height of twelve to four-
teen inches before turning the ani-
mals in. Care should be taken not
to allow the plants to be eaten off
too closely as the young. plants do
not get a chance to recuperate.” To
guard*agninst this it would be wise
to -provide a second plot where the
animals could be turned in for a
time, . Rape {is also grown in con-
junction with oats or with oats and
field pense, and some “authorities
rank Tape and oats next to alfalfa
and red clover for pig pasture.

For young pigs in pasture it Js
not wise to force them to subsist on
what they can get. They should be
fed a little grain. Pigs that are“be-
ing pastured for the purpose of fat-
tening latter should have a limited
grain ration, ‘as this system of feed:
ing has been found most economieal,

Shall { Rear Dniry. Calves In_1919?

in brief, raise all the heifer calves
for which. there ‘Is feed, labor, and
stable-room. More and better cows
are néeded in Ontarlo. The number
of mllk-cows in the province has re-
mained stationary at about one mil-
lion, for a-good many years. There
is n6-ggod reason why this number
should not be doubled in the next ten
years, but it can be.done only by
rearing or buying.» Biying cows is
expensive and risky, It is a far bet-
ter plan to raise cows. THis, means
that all the best-heifer calves should
be saved for future cows, As jt re-
quires from three to. four years to
change calves into cows, in order to
double the cow population In ten
years, making allowandes for neces-
sary discards, we need to begin right
away, in order to attain the desired
object. .

The average number of cows per
100 acres of farm land fm Canada ts
but two, whereas in Denmark it is
fourteen; and in Holland sixteen. We
have a long way to go in rearing
cows, before we have anywhere near
the number which are-found in the
best European dairy countries.
There is but one economical way to
attain this yesult, and that de by
raising practically all the heifer
calves dropped during the next tea
years and as many pure-bred calves
of excellent ancestry, as may be re-
quired for breeding purposés,
