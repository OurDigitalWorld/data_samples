AFTER THIRTY- EIGHT YEARS

Receipts Turn Up to Show that the
the Township Collector of Cotches-
ter Sonth Paid $600.00 Twice.

A very interesting explanation jn
the nature almost of a sensation was
made at the nomination meeting heré
by Wm. Hughson, retired farmer and
lifelong resident of Colchester South.
t will be remembered by the older
residents and it is known to most of
this townsh{p in the year 1880, when
the younger keneration, that Mr. Hugh-
Son unfortunately was. found to “be
$800 in arrears a8 collector of taxes in
tihs township in the year 1880, when
i¢ came to a settlement with the treas-
urer. He believed at the time that he
had paid every cent {nto the treagurer
that he had collected, but ask he could
not account for it by vouchers, he
mortgaged his farm {in order to. pay
the debt. In those days ’such a word
as “efficiency” applied to municipal
accounting was not known, bookkeep-
ing was very crude Indeed, and many
collectors and treasurers went short in
their accounts. by reason of this ays-
tem more than through any dishon-
esty. Recently Mr. Hughson decided
to sell some old pleces of furniture by
uction, and on cleaning out a drawer
in a desk that he had had for nearly
fifty years, discovered among other
papers a number of receipts among
which. was one for $430, given him by
the Harrow school section, and anoth-
er for $144.66 given him by S. S. No.
2, Colchester, as a collector jn those
lays paid the schoo} sections direct
rather than through the municipal
treasurers. These receipts were both
dated 1880, bore the shgnature of the
respective school treasurers and were
sealed with the seal of the school sec-
tion, and had never been audited. As
it is a fact that Mr. Hughson could not
pay money out without having»re-
ceived it, no doubt these receipts’ are
authentic and dedount for his shortage
at tire time, because they were not
turned in to the treasurer as cash as
they should hive been when the an-

al settlement was made, and he was
found to be short somé six hundred
dollars. Mr. Hughson appealed to the
ratepayers atthe nomination for their
judgment as to whether hein all fair-
ness should not be reimbursed his
$600, paid 38 years ago; not to speak
of tho interest on the origina) _pay-
ment made in error. The ratepayers
expressed thelr opinion that it was a
matter which should be dealt with by

the incoming council.

the wire a certain amount of energy,
which transmission we speak of as

Pressure or head to make water flow,
so it requires electric pressure to
make electricity flow. The pressure

is called a volt, in honor of its diy-

in one directtton for half a frevolu-

Proof that the average tiller of the

Was not enough of ft. Potash {s vola-
tile stuff, and In the ferrific heat of the
blast furnaces most of It was driven
off in the form of gas #04 40 lost.

The first obvious problem that the
investigators had to tackle, therefore,
was to recover the potash from the
gas. This was accomplished in the
end by a system of first cooling and
then washing the gas, so that all the
foreign elements {n {it were precipitat-
ed, including, of coursé,. the potash.

By this means the quantity of pot-
ash in the dust was trebled, and in
some instances quadrupled. Still the
investigators were not satisfied. Nhey
cast about for some methiod of increas-
ing the amount of potash produced:

After elaborate and e@xhatstive ex-
periments, continued from the aut-
umns° of 1914 down to the spring of
1916, it was found that*by adding com-
mon salt to the firnacts potash could
be produced in enormously increased
quantities,

The. drawback was that the supply
yas still too limited, depending; as’ It
did, upon thes quantities of wigiron
made, So once again the investigators
got to work, experimenting with re-
gard to the by-products of allied mnd
other Industries. “Success once more
attended their efforts, and sometimes
in quite unexpected directions: as,
for example, the recovery of llarge
quantities of by-product potash im con-
hection with one-procéss of the wool-
combing industry/

Up till comparatively recently the

Method used there for washing the
raw Wool was to scour it in hot wat-
er with alkaMi and-soap in thre@ or
four different vessels, The investiga-
tors discovered that by the simple ex-
pedient of subjecting the. wool to a
preliminary wagh in cold water con-
siderable quantities ‘of nearly pure pot-
ash were recoverable, and many -hun-
dreds of tons weekly are now being
produced from this source alone.

DEEP WATERWAY SCHEME

HAS AGAIN BEEN REVIVED;
GREAT RESULTS MAY. COME

 

 

Project ‘to Connect Great Lakes with
Atlantic Ocean by Way’ of the:
St. Lawrence River De-
clared Feasible. 1

 

The plan for a deep waterway from
tlle Great Likes to” the -Atlantic by
way of the River St. Lawrence has
not lapsed, says a Washington dis-
patch, but will receive a quickening
before long that may lead to import-,
ant results. \

Some timo ago Senator Townsend,
of. Michigan, introduced a resolution
in’ Congress for an investigation of a
Seep waterway project, whose com-
Detion would permit ships of deeper
draugne wun any which now ply the
lakes to enter the harbors of Duluth,
Chicago, Mileaukee, “Detroit, Cleve:

ports, after iirect passage from ocean

KEEP LITTLE ONES
WELL IN- WINTER

Winter is a dangerous season for the
little ones. @he days are so change-
able—one - bright, thé next cold and
stormy, that the mother is afraid to
take the children out for the fresh ain.
and exercise they need so much. In’,
consequence they are often cooped up .
in overheated,. badly ventilated rooms
and are soon seized with colds ‘r
grippe. What is needed to keep the
little Ones well is Baby’s Own Tablets.
They will regulate theystomach and
bowels atid drive out colds and by
thein abe the baby will be able to get
oversthe winter season in perfect aafe-
ty. "The Tablets. are sold by medicirie
dealers or-by mail at 25 cents a box
from The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
Brockville, Ont.
