Ottawn, June 1ith—Sir Robert Borden's compulsory service measure was
this afternoon introduced in the House of Commons. It is called the military
service act, 1917. Thfa, is the name given similar-measures in Great Britain
ond New Zealand, ‘

Sir Robert Borden’g bill commences with a rectial of the compulsory ger-
vice provisions of the militia act pased in 1904. It recites also clauses of that
act which render mfiitth lable to be sent.for service in or out of Canada for
defence thereof.

It then proceeds tO explain that owing to the large voluntary enlistment fi

of those who would, oMerwise be producers.in Canada and the necessity of

th side of Maintaining production’ at highest possible timit, under such circumstances,

the method of drafting’ men as provided in the militia act is unwise and im-
provident, and that the men now required should be secured by a process of
selection, hy ‘

The bill’ proyideés for securing reinforcements, which unless Parliament

further authorizes aré not to exceed 100,000 men.

Class 1—Those wio have attained the age of 20 years and were not born
earlier than the yean $894, and are unmarried, or are widowers but have no
children, baer

Class 3.—Those Who wére born in the years 1883 to 1888, both inclusive,
are unmarried, or gre widowers, but have no children,

Class 4,—Those whovhave attained the age of 20 years and were born not
earlier than the year , and are married or are widowers, who have a.child
or children, 5 fe

Class 5,—Thosé p> Were born in the years 1889 to 1893, both
and are marrried r “widowers who have a child or children,

Clase 6.—Those who were born in the years 1883 to 1888; both
and are macrled or are widowers who have a child of children.
Class 7—Those.whd were born in the years 1876 to 1882, both
are unmarried orate widowers who have no child,

Class 8— whbd were born In the years 1875 to 1882, both
and are married, or are widowers who have a child or children.

Clase 9.—Those “who were born in the years 1872 to 1875, both
and a¥e unmarcied or “2 widowers who have no child.

Claag 10,—Those Who were born In the years. 1872 to 1875, both
and are married or are widowers, who have child or children./ 2

(2) For purposes of this ection, any man: married after June 11th, 1917,
shall be deemed to be unmarried.

(3) Any cla cept Class 1 shall include men. who are transferred
thereto from ahothe @8 as hereinafter provided, and Men Who have come
within Class 7, dince prévious class was called out. -

(4) The order {m which the classes are described In this section shall be

Above the appeal tribunals throughout: all the Provinces there fs a Cent-

Supreme Court of Canada. He is to.determine by regulation the® conditions
upon which appeal may be maode'to him. Provision is made for providing the

All Modern Deviltries.

Friday's attaclk was accompanied by
all the arts and @eviltries of latter-day
war. The enemy guns and gun-crews
had been bathed for days in gas shells
sent over, by Whe long range British
guns. The might was filled with red
incendiary flames. Shells that spurted
molten wnetal in surgitig streams of
golden rain crashed in appalling num-
bers about-the bends of the defending
soldiérs. High explosive and shrapnel
fire, was carried out with such rapidity
that the very earth writhed under the
force of the attack.

Mines that it.had taken over two
years to dig and fill with an_over-
whelming explosive broke into an
avolanche-of flaming destruction ‘in

indeed a Ypres day of retaliation and
victory for the vicious sufferings of
two years and eight months.

PRESBYTERIANS WILL PAY
MORE TO MINISTERS

 

Minimum Salaries In East Will Now
Equal Those-in West. S

 

By unanimous consent the Presby-
terian General Assembly; In session at
Montreal last week, fixed the minimum
salaries of married ministers at. $1,200
Q year, with manse, and single minis-
ters at $1,500 a year, to take effect
January ist next. The mintmum for
ordained missionaries is to be $1,000
married men; $950 for single men.
This means an incrense of the scale
of salaries in the east and brings them
up level with the minimums formerly
established in the west.

OF VALUE TO POTATO GROWERS

 

+

In the animal world breeders have
long recognized the;value of a good
strain. The fact that an’ anima) is
pure-bred does not prevent it being a
cull, and the fact that it isa magnifi-
eent show animal does not \ always
mean that its record of performance
will eclipse that of another. And
lately this iden of selection has been
applied to vegetables, and it hos been
discovered that potatoes of the same

variety may be of vastly different
value for planting. The Experiment
station at Kentville, N, S., secured
eight lots of Garnet Chili potatoes

from different growers in 1915, and
under precisely ‘the same conditions
the crop varied from 36 -buslfels per
acre to.240 bushels; and, planted the
next year, the ylelds from the same
stock varied from 68 to 212 bushels
per acre. Following the Kentville ex-
periment several experiments were
made in New Brunswick with Green
Mountaip and Irish Cobbler potatoes,
and ‘the results showed that potatoes
of the same variety, grown on the
same farm and under the sdme condi-
tions, varied in yield from 25 per
cent. to nearly 100 per cent. The
moral is°very clear. If you wont a
big yleld_you must secure seed which
has developed the capacity of giving
@ big crop. Another éxperiment seem-
ed to show that the seed end of a po-
tato gave a much Iarger.crop than
the root end. ‘

 

DAYLIGHT SAVING.

 

It-now seems assured that Canada
is to have a Dominion-wide daylight-
saving law operative this summer,
under which nll clocks ‘in the country
will be advanced one hour. ~The fect
that tho law ia to be sencral instead
of local will eliminate the objection-
able features eo prominent last year.

The 4de> of Gaylight saving was to
gifow everyone an extra hour of. day-
light in the evening to garden, to play
games or to employ in-any way which
seemed desirable to the Individual; it
was primarily conceived to benefit the
Workingman or the working woman.
Curiously it was this class who found
{t most burdensome when worked un-
der a local by-law. For instance, the
railways did not change their time,
whilethe schools did. The result was
that in many_ households two meals
had to. be prepared instead of one, as
the children had to, have their dinner
between 12 and™1 o'clock, new time,
while the father was obliged to have
his between the same hours, old time,
or an hour later. The same. muddle
occurred in sleeping hours and the
time for arising, and altogether ‘it
cannot be denied that the scheme was
a failure. ~
Under the new plan, railways, post>
offices and all other institutions make
the change, and the disadvantages will
disappear. ‘It is, therefore, probable
that the act will be welcomed by the
great-majority, é¢specially as so many
want to snatch every possible minute
of daylight to work for food produc-
tion this year. ~ ¥

Ottawa, June 7th.—Following 1s cor-
respondence exchanged between Sir
Wilfrid Laurier and Sir Robert Bor-
den yesterday and to-day anent the
proposal for-a coalition Government:

Sir Wilfrid’s Letter.
Ottawa, June 6th, 1917.

Dear Sir Robert: On the 12th of
May you asked me to meet you on
the following day, which T did. After
explaining fully the condition of the
war in the lght of knowledge  ac-
quired during your recent visit to
Great Britain you stated the reasons
which had led you to the conclusion
that compulsory service was necés-
sary, and you explained to me the pro-
visfons of the Military Service Bill.

You then proposed the formation of
A coalition Government upon the basis
that, outside of the Prime_ Minister,
each of the two political parties should
have an equal representation in the
Cabinet, and you emphasized the im-
portance of avoiding, if possible, an
election during the war,

T told you at once that if my co-
operation was desired, I] regretted that
I had not been invited before you had
announced a policy of compulsory ser-
viee, as 1 dreaded very serious diffi-
culties ff a conscription law was pass-
ed by the present Parliament, You
réjoined that you had thought it pre-
ferable to invite me after the policy
had been enunciated rather than be-
fore,

At an interview which took place
on Tuesday, the 29th of May,*you sug-
gested to me that you thought it
necessary to hold a caucus of ‘your
supporters, but desired to consult me
before doing so. I ‘suggested to you
that to hold a caucus of your. support-
ers pending negotiations would not
Hkely tend towards the objects ‘to be
attained. At the snmé time 1 sug-
gested that as I wanted to’ consult
parti¢ularly Sir Lomer Gouin and some
other friends I wold, like to have a
‘lear statement in*writing of your pro-
posal, which you formulated as fol-
lows:—

That a coalition Government should
be formed;

Thiat the military service bil) should
be passed:

That a
to enforce it
election;

That Parliament should be dissolved
and the coalition Government should
seek a mandate from the people.

At the conference on Friday, the 1st
of June, and again on Monday, the
ith, the possible personnel of a conll-
tion Government was considered.
Some not insuperable difficulties in
that, personnel were anticipated, and
the subject was not. concthded, © On
Wednesday, the 6th of June, the final
conference took place at which I an-
nounced that I had not seen my way
clear .to join the Government on the
terms *proposed, T asked you at the
same time {if conscription was the only
basis, to which you replied in-the wf-
firmative. a

At this and previous interviews. I
always stated to you that whenever
conscription was adopted, after a
eonsultation of the people, I would
certainly urge in every possible way
obedience to the law.

Bellev&® me, very sincerely yours,

(Signed) Wilfrid Laurier.

Sir Robert's Reply.

On June 7th Sir- Robert Borden re-
plied as follows:~

Dear Sfmr Wilfrid Laurier: I beg
to. acknowledge your letter of yester-
‘day in which you set forth the sub-
stance of recent negotiations respect-
ing the formation of a coalition Gov-
ernment. At our. first interview you
had expressed the opinion that.com-
pulsory ‘service should mot” be en-
forced until it had been approved by
a referendum or at a general election.
It was for this reason that ] submitted
the further” proposal’ on the 29th of
May, which is described in the fourth
paragraph of your letter.

I agree that it wag.the policy of
compulsary service which, im, your
judgment, made it impossible for you
to join a coalition Government, I
Ywas convinced that compulsory ser-
vice’was necessary, and must’ be {n-

 

pledgé should be given not
until after a general

 

 

 

 

cluded in the policy of the proposed
7

coalition. You, on the other hand,
decided that you could not
such a policy. and that you could not
join a Government which adopted it.
Yours faithfully,

R. L. Borden.

COUNTY COURT

  
 

 

Acting on the ‘suggestion from the
Attorney-General’s Départment, ) Sher-
int’ Anderson has notified faembers of
the jury~panel, stimmoned’for the
next session of the’County Court, that
they need not appear. @

Registered letters notifying them
to this effect have been sent out,..The
matter was put up to the lawyers and
it was by consent that the Cases enter-
ed forjury hearing at the coming ses-
sion were either set down as non-jury
actions or postponed until the fall.

It was decided by the Attorney-
General's Department that, owing to

the idea of taking-advantage of suM-|the greft burden of food production

placed upon the formers, coupled with
the shortage of Tabor, that it would
require all the attention of the farmers
on the land this summer. The lawyers
agreed to cid the increased production
campaign by dispensing with the
juries. .
In, Egsex.. county, this wasreasily
done, as there are no cfirinal cases
set’down for Judge Dromgole tojhear
that would require a jury.. The crim-
Inal division of the Connty Court is
now In session and while several
cases of a serious nature are down
for trial, none of the defendants have
elected for a jury trial. Should ony

tem. In England the order is» a war] do so, it 4a imperative that a jury be

given, as the wishes of everyone ac-
cused™must be followed.

The civil list on the County- Court
docket was started Tuesday by Judge
Dromgole.

Thomas. Howe, aged 35, of Mercer
Street,, was acquitted when he ap-
peared before Judge Dromgole charg-
éd. with o serious offense against his
12-year-old daughter, The girl fafled

{to tell the same story os she did in

‘police cpurt at the preliminary hear-
ding and as there’ waa no corrobora-
‘tive eyidence, the court discharged
Howe. w

WAR TAX ON ‘TOBACCO LAND.

 

A rumor has been in circulation for
somé, {ime among the tobacco growers
of Southern Ontario régarding the pos-
sibjlity of a war tax being placed on
land putin tobacco in 1917 and after-
wards,

The amount of tax mentioned ‘in
some instances reaches the rather high
figure of $20°per nacre. ,

The Tobacco Division of the Depart-
ment-of Agriculture at Ottawd has en-
deavored to ascertain if there is. any
foundation for such a rumon, the re-
sult of the inquiry being that, nothing
of the kind has been heard of in Ot-
tawa, even {n the highest official

circles.
