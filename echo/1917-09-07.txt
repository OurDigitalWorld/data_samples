People with thin blood are much
more subject to headaches than full-
blooded © persous, and the form of
anaemia that afflicts growing girls is
almost always accompanied by head-
aches, together with disturbances of
the digestive organs.

Whenever you have constant or re-
curring headaches and pallor of the
face, they show that the blood is thin
and your efforts should be directed to-
ward building up your blood. A fair
treatment with Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills will do this effectively, and the
rich, red blood made by these pills
will remove the headache.

More disturbances to the health are
caused by their blood than most peo-
ple have any idea of. When your blood
is impoverished, the nerves suffer
from lack of nourishment and you may
be troubled with insomnia, neuritis,
neuralgia and sciatica. Muscles sub-
ject to strain and under-nourished and
you may have muscular rheumatism
or lumbago. If your blood fs thin and
you begin to show symptoms of any
of these disorders, try building up (Ke
blood with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
and as the blood Is restored to ita nor.
mal condition every symptom of the
trouble -will disappear. There are
more people who owe their present
state of good health to Dr. Williams?
Pink Pills than to any other medicine,

and most of them do not hesitate to

say 80.

You can get Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
through any dealer in medicine or by

It is rumored that the “Pelee” is to
be sold to a firm in Toronto for the

worth it.

Denis Knaggs & Son's farm is an
outstandig ‘example of the greater
production movement in every sense
of the word. Using modern tractors;
they cropped a Jarge acreage to wheat
fall, and to oats and barley in the
result being that thresh-
ing the other day, brought them 1,611
bushels of what, 1.360 bushels of Sats,
and 400 bushels of barley, all worth
in the neighborhood of $4,500. It is
probably the Jargest amount of grain
tHreshed on*any ordinary farm in
South Essex, and the production could
not have been accomplished except
by the use of modern machinery, with
motor power,. Mr. Knaggs is a “firm

ever, cannot purchase in Canada, ow-

ing to the limitations placed upon it
by the Imperial treasury, as America
is ready to finance contract® while

Owing to the British €mbargo on
apples, there was considerable anxiety
among growers in all parts,of Amer-
ica as to markets and prices for the
1917-crop. After the poor crop in
smany districts last year, a heavy
output.was anticipated this season.
The reports now being received show
however, that with reasonably equit-
able distribution, the -home markets
should.absorb all the fruit at good
prices. The central portions of the

Miss Duke, teacher in one of the

Tuesday, by Miss Croft, of Chatham,
a former teacher here.

The farmers of the marsh land are
busy harvesting the onion crop. It is
estimated that 300 carloads of onions
will be shipped from Leamington dis-
trict for fall sale. Buyers are now
offering $2.50 per bag.

John Wells, formerly of the town-
ship of Maidstone, died at the House
of Refuge’ Friday morning of last
week. He was 75 years of age and
came to the House of Refuge on Aug-

BEET YIELD UNDER AVERAGE.

 

The sugar beet yield thls year will
be 70 per cent. of a full crop, ac-
cording to an estimate made by C.
Housen, secretary-treasurer of the
Dominion Sugar Company. The wet
weather which prevented the farmers
from planting the early beets, coupled
with the drouth during the warm
weather, damaged the crop. The com-
pany has an acreage of 20,000 for the
plants at Chatham, Wallacetown’ and
Kitchener. School boys and girls
aided materially in overcoming the
labor shortage in the beet fields, and
they were pair $10,000 by the com.
pany for their labors,

WAR NOTES

The Wizard Edison has formmths
been confined to hin home,: divoting
his time mainly to experimmtation
in the interest of America a’ war, and

it Is believed that he hay invented 1%)

possibly on epoch making device for

uso against the submariie. It is un-
derstood that Mr. Ediwn's aims have
been to develop a wespon of offence,
but possessing also dafensive value.
It is thought improbahle that the world
will be informed of any invention by
j dim until after it has actually been
put in use.

Peace by September, 1918,—The
London Times «ays a rate of 50 p. c
has just been accepted in the insur-
ance market to cover the payment of
total losa on any claim should peice
not be declared by September 30th,
1918, By this arrangement: the in-
surers gét 60 per cent. in any case,
but if there fs no peace by that date
they pay the fu)]-amount, thus losing
50 per cent. The impression prevails
that the war will last fully another
year, But for the trouble in Russia,
the war might have been brought to a
close by the end of 1917.

The Spectator has discovered that
the destruction of fruit bearing trees
in the way shown recently. by the
Germans in Fraifice, is inadmissable as
4n act of war and was condemned in
Scripture 3,000 years ago, It proves
by quoting from Deuteronomy XX:
“When thou shalt besiege a city a
long time, in making war against ‘it
to take it, thou shalt not destroy the
trees thereof by forcing an axe
against them; for thou mayst eat of
