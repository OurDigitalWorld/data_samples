"a3 spent on doctors’ bills, with-
out any benefit, as was spent in
Zani-Buk, which effected a complete
cure!” gays Mrs. Fred Gervais of
126 Bleury St., Montreal,

“A rash broke out on my daty's
skin, and she became very fretful
and lost welght. I took her to a
doctor, who gave me some lation to
apply, but it did not do baby: any
good, I then took her to another
doctor, but with the game result.

“Then a friend, who saw the con-
dition baby was in, brought me
some Zam-Buk, which she ao highly
rocommended that I commenced
using it. In one week's time baby
looked much better, and before a
Inonth had elapsed she was quite
wel} egain.

“Baby {s noW the picture of
health, and I think {it wonderful
that $2.worth of Zara-Buk brought
about th!s cra when $30 spent {in
doctors’ treatments did no good
whatover! I certainly advise other
mothers not to experiment with use- -
less remedfes, but to-saye their’
Nttlo ones unnecessary™ suffer:
and themselves nerdless anuety and
expense by using Zam-Buk in the
first place,”

Z7am-Buk {8 also best for eczema,
ringworm, acalp sores, bolls, ulcers,
obscesses; bad legs, blood-poison-

was wonderfully busy about until she
left him comfortably enjoying the sun-

After that she went back to the cot-

bles, and-was soon busily engnged in
painting them alla brilliant red. \

Lieutenant French could stand {t no
longer. He*had painted garden chairs
at home; in fact, he had left paint on
nimost everything there in the Long
Island home, so. that nothing would
ae shabby.

{n admiration and greeting he dropped
a small package, which landed almost

at Betty's feet.

Betty picked up the missive and
gave a little cry of delight.

She unfurled a small American fing

Betty opened the letter and read

--SEW FOR ITALIAN REFUGEES

Another Illustration of Splendid Work
Being Done by the American Red
Cross in. Europe.

A letter from Red Crogs headquar- |
ters at Rome, quoted by St. Paul Pio-
neer Press, says: -,

“Great. success” has attended the
operation of ouvrolrs, or sewing rooms,
for the benefit of women refugees and
the poor women of soldiers’ families
in Italy: These ouvroirs, established
by the American Red Cross, afford em-
ployment to thousands of willingawork-
ers, who thereby are enabled to make
money to maintain themselves and at
the same time supply clothing to oth-
ers of thelr own class at about one-
third the usyal price.”

The initial sales of the products of
the ouvrolrs nt Padua and Taorminh,
Sicily, were gala events in the Lives of
the ‘afflicted refugees. For hours be-
fore the sale opened at Padua long
lines of women awaited thelr chance.
Each person wg allowed to buy only
a given amount. There was also cloth-
ing for men and children.

Concerning the frst public sale at
Taormina, a Red Cross worker in
clinrge of the sey¥ing room wrote:
“The women, mos! of them barefoot
and pitifully ragged, filed past me to
recelve for thely two and one-half lire
(about 35'cents), the freshj not to say
pretty garmenis made by the workers.
One womoy wore a dress of sacking.
Hach was allowed to choose her own
dress, and ead received besides the
dress a chiige of underwear, and, as
long as the stockings we had on hand
held out, a’pair of stockings. The
children yecelved two dresses and a
change of underwear, and the old men
shirts an{ underwear.”

} But it is estimated that, on the present
basis of Provincial subsidies, the nor-
mal demand on the Province will be
about $1,000,000 annually. But it fp
felt that before the percentage of coun-
ty subsidies are increased the present
scale should be tested.

The charge on the Province for Pro-
vincial highways is 70 per cent. of the
outlay, and it Js anticipated that Fed-
eral grants will reifeve this to some
extent. Without materially exceeding
the estimated’ revénue from motor
cars, it Is apparent that an annual ex-
penditure on provincial highways of
from $1.000/000 to $2,000,000 for a few
years, 2 part to be raised by loan,, if
necessary, is safely within the re-
sources of the Pravince.

Exhibition of Woodland Chivairy That
t Impreesed Hunters in the Florida
Everglades So .Much They
Spared the Victor's Life.

£

|- A couple of hunters on the. border
of the Florida Everglades were sur-
Prisedto hear the wild snorts and
whistles of a buck in fight, mingled
with the plaintive bleats of a doe in
distress—a combination of sounds that
Was unaccountable. The men crept
cautiously up, and in*five minutes
reached the edge of an open glade.

In the center crouched a doe, wild
with terror, By hersside was a* fawn
only a few hours old, still too weak
to follow {ts mother, while the old
buck, with bristiing hair, and antlers
lowered, Stood by, snorting in rage and
defiance. His eyes, green iyith rage,
followed, some object moyings in* the.
palmetto scrub on the border of the
gia ee

Looking carefully, the hunters saw
a young panther jjassing backward
and forward {pn on effort to turn the
flank of the defense and get at the

defender. went on gard, but this
panther was evidently in the full flush
of his first strength, and wishout nx-
perience of the prowess of an old’ buck
at bay. 4 ®

Forward and back he crawled, spit-
tlng and snarling, only to find the
buck always between him and the doe.
At last he crouched for the spring.
The buck, snorting grimly, braced nl)
his museles for the coming crash; he
appreciated his danger, but dared the
worst. The doe whimpered and closed
her eyes, but did not desert her fawn.

The panther rose in the air and
eame down within ten feet of the back.
Then the buck went Into the air, and
falling with his feet; together on the
struggling cat, seemed to stab him
through andéthrough. Immediately the
buck rose again and landed a dozen
feet awny. Then he lowered his head
and plunged at the panther.

There was a confusion of flying- dirt
and grass, and again the deer sprang
away. There were now deep cuts on
his head and neck, and his antlers were
splashed with red. 5
» The panther now. tried to creep
away, but again the buck leaped, stab-
bed with his feet together and sprang
away. The cat now Iny gasping, while
the buck watched him with his hair
stiffened into a mane and -eyes that
nearly bulged from his head, Then the”
hunters walked forward.

When the buck saw them he must
have realized that he was completely
in their power. His proud Crest fell,
and he lost allithe swelling part of the
victory; but still he showed no {nten-
tion of deserting the doe, but moved
off and stood beside her. She crouched
down ‘again with the fawn. .

. The hunters walked over quietly and
‘}examined the panther, He was very
‘badly cut up. Both shoulders were
broken, and the antlers had passed re
peatedly through his body. During the
‘examination the buck stood quietly in
‘J plain view, and no gindiator saluting
