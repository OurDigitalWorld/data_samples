‘he had suddenly appeared In. Brierly
with the blue racing car. Soon It was
rumored that he had made a fortune
in the mines.

The second week after his return
Stanwood bought the old Blain man-
sion and gave the Information that he
intended to taove Into hif new home
before Christmas. Next*he tinnounced
that preparations were under wa for
a porty which he was giving Christ-
mins eve.

The evergreen ‘girl liad been sur-
prised and ao little ‘bit hurt because
Dane had not even called. She had
thought It strange, toopfat first, that
she did not recelve an Invitation to
the»party, for she knew'nently every:
one In Brierly was going.

But when Ruth was told the party
wns to be given fn honor of Starvood's
fiancee, she understood why she had
not been invited.

“phat Isavhy Helen Stanwood didn't
mention the party.when she ordered
these wreaths,” Ruth thought, as she

I woul] not go anyway now. My, but
they will lave to hurry if they hang
all these wreaths before eight o'clock."

The evergreen girl was 80 Duay get-
ting the Stanw ‘ood order ready that she
did not notice that the blue roadster
had returned ond stopped by the gate.
Neither did she observe the brond-
shouldered young man Who was striding
up the path, The bell jingled merrily.

“~)here’s Helen now, ofter the
wreaths,” Ruth thought, and she ran
to the door, ‘Dane was standingin the
porch, | ’

“Why, Dane!” she exelaimed, draw-
Ing back ip confusion. “How you
startled me, I thought {¢ was. your
sister, and—”

“}Telen has gone to Balford to meet
a friend who Is to spend the holidays
with us,” sald the young man, “so she
sent me after the wreaths.” He smiled
down at the girl “This is the ever-
green shop, isn't 169"

«yos,” sald Ruth, forcing a smile in
return,

“and you are the evergreen girl?”
l@ “I believe they call’ me that,” ahe
answered. ia

She mny not geiback until nine o'clock,

Then she Wwpened to think -of you,
and T gnld reht off that you would be
just the oneto help us out. You're not
golng to diappoint us, are you?” very
anxiously.

“Well, prbaps T cansgo.for a little
while,” anf Ruth. “I'd dearly love to
trim that Zhristmas tree.”

“Of couse, I won stay to the

upstairs niter a wrap, “so I won't see
Dane's switthenrt, for of course she is
the one Hilen tg to meet at the train.
And I regly ought to help Dane and
his sister at, for they have been suck
good custdners.”

Dane whered Ruth into the big
double parors of his new home, where
the Christoas tree had been placed.

“Do yol suppose,” he asked, polnt-
ing to n great pile of evergreen nt one
end of t)¢ room, “we will be able to
hang all these wreaths and then deco-
rate the tree before elght o’elgek 2”

The evergreen girl guve-a merry lite
tle laugh. ¥

“I am sure weican If we work fast,”
she answered. “I am used to this
work, you know, and with your help
it won't take long.”

“How long have you been the ever
green girl?” Dane asked, a8 he and
Ruth were trimming a chandeller,

“This Is my third season,” Ruth re
plied “I found that there was a big
demand for wrenths and Jaurel trim-
ming during the Christmas holidays,
so three years ago I opened pn ever-
green shop, I love to do this kind of
Work, and although the season in @
short one, my little shop pays well.”

The evergreen girl might have added
that, more than this, the rush of work
just at Chriatmas time helped her to
forget the dull ache in her heart which
wns always so bord to bear dunng the
holidays. She sald nothing of this,
though, but asked, instead:

“Tell me, Dane, how you have spent
Christmas while you have been awny.
Have you been where there was much
merry-making?"”

“For the past three years,” sald
Stanwood, “I've celebrated Christmas
by working from dawn till dark. This
1s the first. enjoyable Christmas eve I
have known since I left’Brierly.”
|. “It has been a very pleasant eve-
ning for me, too,” said Ruth, “ond I
have enjoyed it ever&so much: Now.
we'll trim the Christmas tree, and then
you, can’.take.me home and get back
in time forthe party.”

At half-past seven Dane surveyed

 

 

: the big double parlors with satisfaction.

With the help,of the evergreen girl he
find fintshed the decorations and every-
thing was in readinéss for the guests.
“The rooms look just as they did
four years ago at Dolly Blair's Christ-
mas tree—evyen the mistletoe ,bough,”
pald Dane. “Don't you remember how
that one hung right over our heads, as
this on@ does now?" =a
The evergreen girl was silent. {
“Hod you forgotten, Ruth?” he per
alsted.
“No,” softly, “I had not forgotten.”
“You never thought I had forgotten,
did you, dear?”
“But you never wrote, Dane.”
“Because for a long time I was miles
from 4 railroad or post office and could
nop send .any»mall. But I’ve thought
of that night, though, and all these
years I've been planning to -have a

ns I could, only this one, tonight will
be for you.” 4

“But Isn't the friend who is coming
with Helen four fiancee?” faltered
Ruth.

“Not exactly,” laughed Dané., “That
friend is Harry North, Helen’s flance.

“now, and, by Jove! I've caught’ her
ngain standing under the mistletoe
bough.”

réniding to be seen,

Road improvement \was-miterially
affected by war-conditions during the
years of 1917-18, more especifjly: by
scarcity of labor, high wages, and Jac)
of railway services for transporting
materials. Acting on the general prig-
ciple that all kinds of unnecessary ex.
pendi‘ure should undoubtedly be avold-
ed in time of war, both national ang
municipal, the department did not en-|
courage road  constructio except |
wher dictated by means of ef-
ficiency and economy,- Since the war}
is over, the improvement of roads ts
a question that has arain come to the
front. It {s recognized that the waste
of time in transporting goods or driv~
ing over bad_roads is great; that much
inefliciency {s created by bad r-ads,
and that because of bad roads, farm
produce is frequently lost or greatly
depreciated by the inability to plidce
{t on the market. Road meintonaonce
means larcely that a Umited arjount of
time and effort are expended on the
repairs and improvements of the
roads in order that @ great and com-

| paratively large amount of time and

enérgy may- be saved in travel and
transportation over them; in order
that atill other traffie wuhch would
have to take less economical routes
will follow the improved road; &nd fm
order that ntill other traffic which
would not exist may be created and
developed. Every ono with the {nter-
est of his municipality at heart should
energetically devote his efforts to or-
ganization for road improvement oot
only for the comfort and convenience
it would bring to them individually but
also that this important work may be
utilized as far as possible in adjust-
ing our “after-the-war” problems. Ev-
ery oportunity-to secnre improved road
system should be seized upon. The

Mr. Editor,—Complainig at present
about the impassible condition-of the;
ronds in this part of the county, and
‘specially that part from Harrow to
IKingaville, which a titizen of the-for-
mer village says Is the worst stretch
of road from here to Toronto, is gen-
ral, and travelling over them either
by motor or buggy‘is well nigh impos-
sible, especially In the vicinity of Ar-
heir, east of the townline, where it is a
usi#al sight each day at present to seo
onf or more autoes stalled and under
the necessity of ®eing drawn out by
hojrses. That this condition of roads
shyould be tolerated by taxpayers and
the general travelling public fs a
conundrum to me, seeing that this part
of the township is so heavily assessed
sto maintain a, proper highway, and
yet year after year nothing is done by.
the council for the upkeep of the road
in this locality excepting for a few
loads of gravel dropped here and there,
Dut none for the first mile enst of the
townilne, but that part of the road
was overdone this past year by the
building’ of an extravagant cement
culvert. Autolats find the 2nd conces-
sion, in fact two-or three of the con-,
cessiona north of the sectioh road a
much better highway to travel over,
and, the reason {s not far to seck, see-
ing these roads get the attention of the
council as well as the gravel, not to
mention the Diyfsion Road, which by
way of comparison {s Ike a boule-
yard, and dt the expense of the rate-
payers from the west part of the|-
township in.a large proportion. One
does not require very much discern-
ment fo see the unfairness of our
municipal council in treating the rate-
payers of this community in such ao
manner. A radical change in the
council board might be a means of
improving the condition of the affairs
of this western part of Gosfield South
