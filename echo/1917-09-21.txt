Federal politics are beginning to
warm up in Essex county. A sugges-
tion was made, in some quarter, with-
out a definite knowledge of conditions
in the county, that two acclamations
should be allowed—the Liberal candi-
date, °W. C. Kennedy, in the North,
and the Conservative candidate, who-
ever he might be, in the South. In
reply to this suggestion, Wm, Wool-
Jatt, president of the North Essex
Conservative Association, hastens to
place himself on record as opposed to
acceptipg such & suggestion. Mr.
Woollatt stated he had the very high-
est regard for Mr. Kennedy, but the
Conservative party could not be ex-
pected to endorse his candidature
while his leader, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
was opposed to conscription. Con-
servatives in South Eésex are also not
taking the suggestion seriously, but
are busy getting ready for a party
fight. Last issue of the Leamington
Post, which favors W. T, Gregory as a

the county the past year had a very
serious effect upon tha humber of ex-
hibits of horses, cattle and swine. at
Essex County Fair, whic was held
on Tuesday, Wednesday end Thurs-
day of this week at Essex. As one
old time exhibitor tersely expressed
It: “No oats, no  horses,”-and he
might have added: “No corn, no
hogs.”* As will be seen by the list of
entries below, there was a remark-

Otherwise the Fair was a remark-

most beautiful days this fall. As a
consequence the crowd was immense,
