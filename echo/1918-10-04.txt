This was President Wilaon’s ans-
wer given to-night before an audience
of fourth Liberty Loan workers here,
}to the recent peace talk thom the
central powers, although he did jot
refer spédifically to the utterances of
enemy leaders.

the President, “of coming to terms,

“It would be folly to leave the guar-
antee to the subsequent voluntary ac-
tion of the governments wo have seen

anid the President. -The President
emphasized that justice to be obtained
by the Leagug must Involve no dis-

is aet forth explicitly in a set of five

of which “the United States is pre-
pared to-assume {ts full share of re-,

FRIDAY, OCTOBER 4th, 1918

 

Tho Lieutenant-Governor of the Pro-
yince of Ontar{o has issued a proclam-
ation naming next Wednesday, Octo-
ber 9th, as Fire Prevention Day
throughout the Province, and urged
that attention ba called on that day in
schools and public places to conditions
of uncleanliness and carelessness that
exist leading to destructive and costly
fires, andi means of removing these
conditions, The Echo has for years
advocated that every fire, no matter
how small or large, be investigated
by coroner’s Inquest This would
bring right home to the people the
great carelessness that exists every:
where, endangering not only Ue prop-
erty of the porson who neglects to take
lordinary precautions but also adjoin-
jing properties. A few Inquest would
do more to impress the need of tak-
ing properties, A few inquests would
all the lectures and precepts that can
be spoken or published,

Additional orders affecting the pub-
lishing of newspapers Were announced
recently by Chairman Baruch, of the
U, S. War Industries Board, to bring
about a further saving of print-paper
in the United States, The board rules
that publishers shalhnot use premium.
confasts or similar means to stimu-
late circu on; that no holiday, in-
dustrial or special issues shall be pub-
Nahed, and that papers shall not be

The Union Pair at Amherstburg on
Monday and Tuesday drew the larg-
est crowd in its history. Thes® smaller
shows are growing to be more and
more big family gatherings where
friends from far and near meet once
& year to renew acquaintance and
have a jolly time regardless of wheth-
or the exhibits are good, bad or in-
different. Fortunately the show of all
classes of produce at Amherstburg was
good though it fell below what ought
to be a proper mirror of the possi-
bilities of this productive district.
Fruit this year wns the outstanding
feature, the exhibit of apples and
pears being the finest ever seen ,here.
Tho offerings were so many and var-
Jed that he canned fruit had to be
banked on the center stand. P. L.
Fanchor, of Chatham, who judged this
display. expressed great delight at the
carefulness evidenced in the selection
of the varieties, and-the neatness of
arrangement. In the same part of the
building, Mra, Duers, of Goderich, and
H. J. Bell, of Walkerville, spent two
hours placing the prizes on the butter
exhibits. The keenest competition
here was for A. J. Green's special
prizes of $26 for 25 tbs. of buttor. It
wis Won as follows: 1st 10 Ths., Mra.
Lo C. British; 2nd-40 tbs, Mrs. Frank
Ist & Ibs.. Mrs. Bd. A. Me-
Gee. All these premier butter. mak-
ers ‘sre from Malden, whose slogan
might with propriety be changed to
“Wheresthe best butter makers grow.”
Mrs. J. W. Noble, of Eissex, assisted
by Mr. Bell, judged the canned fruit,
and found it excellent. Some excep-
tion was taken to opeming: cans of
fruit to test the quality, and the
judges announced that thiis would not
be done aguin at the , Fair. The
Ladies’ Work was very beautiful and
occupled ‘more «space tt usual, Not-
withstanding the fagt that the show {s
open to the world, and large quanti-
ties of work were brought in by Mrs.
Clark and MresLee, of Kimgsyille, our
own Jadies figure largely in the dis-
tribution of ‘prizes, winning most of
the prizes in, the different depart-
ments

The rest of the ground floor in the
building was taken up with pianos
and other musical instruments shown
by J®J, Brauk, Grinnell Bros., and
Heintzman & (Co, all of whom de-
gorve the hearty thanks of the direc-
torate for their generous musical

PERTINENT QUERIES =

ON ASSESSMENT

Bureau of Municipal Research Issues
Bulletin on: the Subject.

The Ontario Asscssmont Act = and
the way it is applied in the different
muncipalities is the subject of a time
ly bulletin by the Bureau of Municipal
Research. In amending the “Assess-
ment Act, the Committee of the Leg-
Jslature which whs appointed last ses-
sion will doubtless conaider the mate
ner in which the present act {fs ap-
plied in different cities.

The law states. that land shall be
assessed at its actual value, and
Duildings at the difference betweon
the selling value of the whole prop-
erty and tho selling value of the land
minus the buildings.

The Act is applied, according to the
bulletin, on improved and unimproved
land in ao number of different ways
and combinations of. different ways
that are not only confusing but ex-
tremely inequitable ‘when the. Pro-
vinclal war taxis applied. 8

In conclusion, the bureau propounds
the following questions:

What is the meaning..of. “selling
value’? ~ ;

What {s-the “actual value” of land
and buildings?

Why should one municipality con-
tribute more in proportion to the
Provincia] War Fund than another?

Why should one citizen.contribute
more in proportion to city or Pro-
vinoial funds than another?

Wonld’ a” Provincial Bureau of
Equalization help solve the diffoulty?

HARLES DICKENS is one of the world’s great teachers.
Here is what he has to say in one of his books:

“My other piece of advice,,Copperfeld,”” eaid Mr.

Micawber, “you-know.

Annual income £20, annual

expenditure £19, 19. 6—result, happiness. _ Annual

income £20, annual expenditure
The blossom is blighted, the leaf is withered,

the God of Day goes down upon the dreary scene,»
and—and in short you are forever floored. As Tam.”

The saving of a part of one’s in-
come was always a good policy.

Prudent. men and women have
always maintained a margin of
saving. =

But to-day we must go farther in

our effarts to save than ever before.

To-day it is*a matter of the
gravest. importance that each
Canadian seek ways and means
to economize by cutting down ex-
penditures for unnecessary things,
saving the money he ‘spends on
things he could. do without, so

that when the Nation needs to,

borrow money he will be in a posi-
tion to do his full duty.

FRENCH WAR DOGS.

Not every one realizes the import-
ant place which dogs are’taking in this
war: Of course, the Germans began
training dogs for way uses Many years
ago, but the French did nothing if

that line for two. years after war had |

begun. They now have: 18,000 dogs
trained or Jn training. These are
cared’ for by the Blue Cross, which,
at the request of the French Govern-
mént, has attached a dog hospital to
ali-thé Blue Cross base Hospitals in
France where war horses are treated:
All dogs named by the French army
are received at these bases, disinfect-
ed and-quarantined. They are then
assigned for duty*or training.

Terriefs are used to free the-trench-
es_of rats,-and the larger dogs are
used for patrol work, to police pris-
oners, as first aid to ambulances to
carry appliances and..water, to seek
out wounded men in shell holes and
out-of-the-way places. .It Is said that
Samoyede dogs have actually saved
the guns to which they were harness-
éd; they carry shells,and even draw
sleighs and light transport. Perhaps
most important of all are the messen-
ger dogs, which can travel where men
cannot g0, andvexceed any Other mes-
senger except the pigeon in speed

ing 2g or 24 miles an hour, and are
literally, “faithful unti death,” striv-
ing even when wounded to perform
thelr allotted task No one would
question for an instant the fine appre-
elation which has caused the French
Government to “mention” its dogs in
despatches.

So far, over 1,000 Freach dogs have
been treated at the hospitals. _ All
operations on dogs and horses are
performed under anaesthetics — by.

HOW

BY JOHN W. 8. McCULLOUGH, M.D., D.P.H., CHIEF OFFICER
OF THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF HEALTH.

TO KEEP WELL

BLINDNESS OF BABIES.

NE-HALF of all the blindness is preventable. One-tenth af all the
preventable blindness is due to babies’ sore eyes, which; is “an
{nflammatory disease of the conjunctiva usually appearing with
the first few days of life.and generally due to micro-organisms.”

Let us state it again in simplerdanguage. Within two days after the
birth of the baby some matter {s noticed-in the corner of the eyes. Within
an hour or two it will be noticed that the eyes are red, and yellow pus is
oozing from between the lids. “A little tater the-éyelids are noticed to be
puffed. If a little of this pus be placed under the microscope it will bé seen
that the suppuration is due to pus germs.

Babies’ bore «yes is preventable, is contagious, is curable if treatment
If treatment is delayed a single day it may be found that
the sight is gone, sincé the disease runs a very rapid and violent cotrse.

Some motbers think that babies’ sore eyes are due to the light or to
cold. Some even think that it fs due to the conjure put on the baby by
some evil person. The first group of mothers laugh at the ignorance and
superstilion of the second group, but without justice, since their opinion
{is not nearer the truth than that of those at whom they laugh. F

Baties’ Bore eyes are an infection and are due to*pus cocci getting into
the eye during birth, at the time.of birth, or soon after. Thirty-six years
ago an hocpital surgeon, by name Crede, noted that one-ninth of the babies
born in his hospital developed babies’ sore eyes. He commenced the policy
of dropping a two per cent: solution of nitrate of silver into the eyes of
each baby as soon as it had hadits bath. In six years the babies’ sore eyes
rate in his honpital dropped from one in nine to one in four hundred.

The resplt of this experience was & hep’ policy in caring for the eyes
of a newly-born babe. Immediately after birth the baby Is given his bath
and his eyes are treated. Each eye is wiped with a piece of absorbent
cotton dipped in a saturated solution of boric acid (boiled water will do as
well as beric acid solition). A’separate pledget-of cotton is used for each
eye. The cotron isnot put back Into the solution after-touching the eye.
Next the cyelids aré gently separated with the fingers.and one drop or two
drops of one per cent. solution of nitrate of silver is dropped into each eye.
This is done only once. It is done not to cure sore eyes Lut to prevent eyes
ffom becoming core, -

“If the «yes begin to suppurate the doctor must be sent. for without
delay. The sight cannot be saved unless treatment is b gun at once.

THE CAUSE OF DEAFNESS.

Consanguincous marriages, heredity, infections, fevers, middle ear
diseases resulting from colds, sore throats, infections of nose sinuses, and
bad tonsils, berculosls, and syphilis, accidents and injuries, working at
noisy trades, snd taking quinine or salicylates in large doses are the causes
of deafpess.

“T wns a great sufferer from Rhenm-
atism for over 16 years, I consulted
specialists, took medicines, used
lotions ; but nothing did me good.

Then, I began to use “Fruit-a-
tives’?; and in 15 days, the pain was
easier and the Rheumatism was
better. Gradually, ‘7 rutt-a-tives'’
overcame my Rheumatism; and now,
for five years, I have ‘had no return
of the trouble. Also, I had severe
Eczema and Constipation, and
‘‘Frult-a-tives’’ relieved me of these
complaints ; and gaye me a good
appetite ; and in every way restored
me to health’. P.H. MCHUGH.

NO NEW COAT FOR BINDLE
Mothe Play Leading Role In Geasona:
blo Tragedy, All In Favor of the
Lucky Wifey.

“I wonder whether I must wear that
last winter's coat again this season,”
mused Bindle as he dragged the trunk
“ of the closet and into the light of

lay.

“I am afraid you will!” exclaimed
Mrs, Bindle. “That's a perfectly good
coat. I don't remember seeing you in
one that looked nicer on you. It al-
ways had such atylish lines. It made
you look so boyish, don't you know!”

“No, I don't know,” replied Bindle
sadly. “I had my eye on one of those
new fashioned military effects—with
the belt attached and all that.”

“Why, my dear!"-snid Mrs. Bindle,
“a man fn civil life hos no excuse for
trying to look like a drum major. If
he wants a military cut, there is just
one place to do it.”

“I get you!” said Bindle. “And if
I have to wear that last year’s over-
coat again, I'd just as soon join the
army—a whole lot sooner.”

Bindle raised the lid of the trunk
and fell back in astonishment.

“Look! Wife, come quick!” he
shouted. “Ah, here is some of your
efficiency for you. Gaze downward at
this thriving moth village in our Ittle
trunk of winter things. How did this
happen?”

“Don't know. Can't see how a
moth. got In—tho trunk was locked.”

“Oné of ’em had a key, I suppose,”
sald Bindle. “Didn't I fell you Jast
fall to put some tobacco In the trunk
for the moths?"

“Yes, dear, but I wasn't sure of the
kind of tobacco they liked. You didn’t
say whether smoking or chewing.”

“There you are,” said Bindle, bring-
ing forth a near-seal coat of his wife's
from the depths. “Your best garment
shot full of holes. I figured that coat

 

years. That's what you sald when
you bought it.”

“But there is a new style on the
market this year! I’m just os well
pleased that the moths made merry
with this one. I really want ajjcoat
of the new avintrix model.”

Each time that Bindle came up for
oir he brought something else that the
moths had feasted on. Mrs. Bindle’s
two winter sults were .peek-a-boos.
Her sweater jackets and sport coats
were reduced to skeletonized form.
The last thing to coméout of the fIl-
fated trunk was Bindle’s last winter's
overcont. He held it up—perfect!

“Thonk goodness for that!" cried
Mrs, Bindle. “I’m so glad it was my
things-those awfnl moths ate instead
of yours; Meredith, Ill haye to get
an entire pew outfit and you, lucky
boy, can wear that coat another sea-

pon.”—Chicago News.

 

Youngsters Love Soldiers.

The old saying that “all the world
loves a lover” might be*changed these
military days to “every kid loves a
soldier,” or his unlform, at least. Just
watch the little boys and girls as a
soldier passes. Those admiring glances
would not be bestowed on a “slacker.”
Here are two cases in point, cites the
Indianapolis News: :

“I jus’ lov ou soders,” sald three
year-old Charles Ullrich, son of Fred
Ullrich, Big Four agent at Shelbyville,
as he entwined his arms about the-

neck or)

burg. Reed, with several Decatur

. county soldiers from Camp Taylor,

were on the way to Greensburg, by
way of Shelbyville, ptid the sergeant
after buying a ticket had Jeaned up
against the railing of the ticket office
when tho threc-year-old hugged him.

‘A second illustration occurred when
Sergeant Reed reached Greensburg on
the way to his parents’ home. He was
confronted ‘by a tiny soldierly Ogure
that saluted with gil the grace aad
courtesy of a’ trained soldier. The
sergeant exchanged the lute, aod
then legrned the tribute hnd been paid
by six-year-old Henry J' 1D, Son of
Prof. B..J. Jerman, superintendent Cd

Greensburg’s city schools.

Why They Stopped.

One morning recently the chikiren of
the Indianapolis Orphans’ home were

—not @-sound escaped their lips. The
leader, very ain a and
chagrined at the en,
gilence, sald, “What is the matterf"_
In one accor as ‘replied, “We
can’t sing that ni! ine.”
She looked at the words and the
line read,

will leave that entire stanza out.” She
had not thought ef finding enything

THIS HURRYING AGE |e" eS ENCH FARMERS SAVED
Has Forced Authors to Recognize - JHE DAY. ¢

Changed Customs.

The saving farmor is a national asset. Canadian progress to-
day in all lines attests magnificently to the splendid qualities of thrift
that have marked the farmers in all the Provinces. The total returns
from field crops and animal produce have been only possible because
of the disposition. to make use in an economical way of all the won-
derful gifts of Providence in thia good land of ours.

The same was abundantly true after 1870 in France when the
frugal, thrifty farmers of ‘that fair land made it possible for the Re-
public to pay off that hated German war {indemnity of two billion
francs levied against. them. The same spirit of national thrift built
up France for the extreme test to-day—a test that fs being tried by

fire, ,

Thanks be, French heroism is proving true, The line is holding.
The blood of the farmers is flowing equally as well through the veins
of France's daughters of the soil and so the national strength bends

but does not break.

Canada is reaping her harvests of increased returns and money
ia belng made as never before. Otir farmera are earning the grati-
tude of all in their splendid efforts at production. That they will
carry into their savings on equal foresight in conserving their sur-
pluses against the fyture days of darkness and lower prices will be
equally praiseworthy. He ts well advised who saves his extra dollar

Making Shrapnel.

New Inventions have been made by
Americans,- and American machine
tools for shell making have bee sent
to Europe and are used In the factories
there. The number of shells of shrap- |
nel made in this country 1s almost be-
yond computation, Long before we eD-
tered the war our different factories
were turning out. hundreds of thion-
sands of shrapnel a week, and it was
due to this demand for munitions that
enabled us to turn out the big Hroduct
we are now making. This {# go not
only of shrapnel, but of pow@er and
explosives of all kinds. Before the war
one company was making abgyt 400,

SULTAN IS FOND OF READING
Turkey’s Ruler for Weeks at a Time

Shute Himself in Private Suite,
" Surrounded With Books.

Althotgh the sultan of ‘Turkey Is
reputed to be the Inaleat potentiate In
Europe, he is passionntely fond of
reading, For weeks at a time he will
shut himself in his private sulte, sur-
roundec by liternture of all kinds—
classical works, novels, magazines und
newspapers. With the exception
his personal attendants and ministers
of state, no one is nowed fn the tm-
perial sanctunry during the sultan's
literary “fits.”

But the sultan 1s at something of a
disadvantnge, says a British weekly,
becouse his knowledge of LCuroyerin
languages Is limited.

In order to overcome the diMenity
he employs a translation office, Here
there are officinis who speak nll: the
longunges of Europe’ and the ust.
They rend all the pdlitical and illas-
trated newspnpers of importance, nnd
translate extracts from them for the
sultan. There ore 15 superior trans-
Intors, called dragomnh secretaries, in
that office, and tielr pay Is from ten
to forty Turkish pounds monthly.

They do not Iimit thelr transintions
to political publications; they trans-
Inte novelS and romances in all Inn-
guages for the Sultan. and wny
thousand volumes of their work have
found their way into the imperial lib-
rary. They are‘all written on thick,
white, royal, octnyo, ‘giit-edge paper,
nnd are fastened together with
green ond red ribbons by the transla-
tors themselves.

After circulating through the harem
they are preserved in the library. The
sulton's. favorite reading {8 criminal
romances. He subscribes to oll news
papers that contain reports of tho
proceedings in the Inw “courts, and
there {s no fnmous writer of stories
of crime in any language whose works
have not been translated for him.

HOW TO USE COAL PROPERLY

House Should Not Be Allowed to De-
come So Warm That Doors.and
Windows Are Opened.
+

If you want to snve coal never al-
low the house to gef so,hot that you
have to throw open the windows and
doors. Thermostats nre chenp these
days. They nutomatically slow down
the fire when’ the temperature 1s ris-
ing to the uncomfortable polnt.

To get the moSt out of the heat fn
coal, the house alr should be changed
once an hour. Arrangements for such
a change should have been made when
the house was built. But if that was
overlooked when the honse was built
you can get the chanze of alr in sev-
eral ways, soys a writer in the Amerl-
eqn Magazine. I do not belfeve In get-
ting this result by having loose win-,
dows, a8 we used to do on the farm.
IT prefer tight windows, cnrefully
weather-stripped. If thnt has not been
arranged for, or If the cost {3 too
great, I find that storm windows are
relatively cheapé Then, alr slots which
let in alr when you want {t are good.

British Government Has Done Well in

Converting Vast Tracts Into Areas

of Cultivation.

Since William the Conqueror first
Intd waste to a ‘smiling countryside’ to
make a deer park, and forbade com-
mon men to hort in that great tract
he called his “New Forest,” millions of
acres of fertile English land hnve
served no purpose useful to the race.
The nobles of medieval times, and their
children's children after them, loved
above all things the chase, and_ they
paid scant heed to those beneath them
who sought to draw their living from
the soll. If there were room for deer,
and foxes, and hares, and moor and
marshland for falcons to soar above,
or gentlemen to shoot over, they did
not care. :

England was prosperous and secure.
Many yenrs ago her governments defi-
nitely abandoned the idea of making
the land self-supporting. The seas were
safe to British commerce, and none be-
lleved the time would come when the
nation’s needs would compel the use
of pleasure parklands, The country
grew old gracefully, and enjoyed it.
It was not decadent, only too well ‘con-
tent. af

All this the war has changed, and
for the better. Britannia still rules
the waves, but beneath the waves He
unseen terrors, menacing the nation’s
commerce, its food supply, its very
life, The nation cannot trust its sen-
borne trade now, It must utilize every
possible means to provide tle neces-
sary sustenance for {ts armies, and for
those who supply the fighting men.
And the British government rises to
the oceasion.

Before the svar Lloyd George fought
long and well, to compel the brenking
up of old estates, to make possible the
cultivation of land long Idle, to give
the Inborer a chance at+the soll. He
failed, for the British’ are conservative
by Instinct, and the old way seemed
ensiest; They’ have learned their les
son now,

In three years past the British gov-
ernment has taken over outright no
leas than 1,000,000 acres of British soll,
purchasing some, renting more. It hans,
indeed, found necessary the establish-
ment of a great department to handle
this work of national regeneration. * It
{sa great change, and one that should
not be regretted. The English which
makes peace will not be the England of
{ts fathers, but a better one, less ats
tractive, It may be, to tourists, less
bénutiful to ‘look upon externally, but,
surely, far more of an {nspiration to Its
neighbors which travel, in company,
the road to real democracy. * p

Beyond Writer’s Power.

Coningsby Dawson says, in telling of
his disinclination to keep even na note
book.nfter he went to:the front, though
he had-been a professional writer:

“One has strange feeling about
books when he Is in the Immediate
presence of denthy I remember an
onecdote of a great Swedish writer
which partly illustrates “my mood.
The watchers by his bedside-thought
he was dead. Suddenly he raised him-
self up. a

“‘Now-F-cduld write,’ he whispered.
They were his last words.

“In the IMght.of my experience at

petty personal problems which we
cloak in words’ and call Iiterature
seem so ignoble a presentation of men
and women who are planned for im-
mortality and live In‘an infinite world.
