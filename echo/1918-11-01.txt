JOIN SPLIT SHIPS
WHILE THEY FLOAT

U. S. Engineers announce Completion
of New Caisson.

Engineers of] the [United States
Shipping Board, at Montreal, are-com
pleting a caiss6n expected to permit |
of the rejoining of vessels, cul in half
to enable their passage through the
Welland Canal, without patting the
wesseb iin drydock, The feat. seemed
impossible when first suggested last
year, but the engineers have proved |
its feasibility by rejoining 12 halved
ships while they were afloat

Temporary frames of 6x6-Inch angies
are placed around ,both sections of}
the ship at the point ctt in such a.way)
that they can be drawn close together}
when thé ship is joined. There ingles
are bored for two-inch fitted bolts. The
plates of the shell. tank top and deck |
whigh do not but on the
frames are taken off, and, where ne-
cessary, light. patches ‘are put on to
support the angle frames. W hen the
two sections df the ships are floated
water balinst is used to trim_the ends
until they come together. sFinal od*
justment fs then made by driving drift
pigs fn the two-inch holes in the spec-
ja] frames. Fitted bolts are then in-
serted and the ships holds firmly to;

| never grows emotional or ia otherwise
| than calm and moderate In expression
} he sets forth a most damning picture.
‘After showing how unconquered
French repatriates) are after months
of prison Brutality he gives it aé his
‘bellef that the German tyranny does
{ not consist simplf#in an exorbitant ap-
plication of the dogma.of might. “It
has special mortifications, peculiar to
the race, which make jt even more
painful if that 1s possible. “If in not {n-
spired solely by the systematic des-
_ potism and. immorality cynically
adopted by Germany; it 1s not a pure,
unadulterated application of ‘any doc
trine; it springs from a genuine lack
of morality, and from a well-spring of -
vicious animalism, which psychologists
have so often detected In the German
blood. ,
|. “Not,” he adds, “that I am so foolish
as to hold “that all Germans are low,

sald without hesitation that such Is,

Men of Middle Age Indulge in
Comparisons

Lack of Thrift tn Rising Generation
Especially Subject of Comment—
Finally Thoroughly Convinced
“The World Do Move.”

Two plainly dressed, snbstantial
looking men of fifty or therenbouts
were: discussing the high cost of Iv-
ing, dying and every other old thing
while having their shoes polished In
a place just off Herald square, One
was saying he couldn't figure how per-
sons of , small ~ earning cnpacity
were manogiig to keep body and
soul together. The other ventured the
opinion that the- class of persons he
referred. to were not entitled to the
sympathy they were getting because
their atandard of Hiving was out*of
all proportion to thelr pay envelopes.

“When we were youngsters back in

| the..middle West,” the second man
went on, “we considered ourselves
lucky if we got some plain schooling
and three fairly square menls a day.
We had pennies where the average
\ boy in this town has dimes and guar
\ters. After we came. to New York
we walted untif=we were fairly well
established before we indulged in
even amall luxuries, It seems to me
that small wage earners have lost all
sense of thrift.”

veo as he spolm thea» came an f-
lustration of his remarks In the per-

gon of. a messenger boy, who climbed |
‘into the next seat and directed the

bootblack to pollsh hfs russet shoes
and put In new Iaces. After giving
this order the boy bit a five-cent bar
of thocolate in half, took a cigarette
from a ten-cent package, and then set-
tled down to read a magazine that had
cost 15 cents. The, two men exchanged
amused glunces.

“That boy's shine and refreshments
and other things will cost him fifty-
five cents,” said the man who had been
doing most ofthe talking. “Honest,
