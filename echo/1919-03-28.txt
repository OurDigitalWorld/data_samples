is showing—Irish Cobbler, the early
seed, and the Green Mountain—have
been the subject of widespread dis-
cussion. There has been much dif-
4 ference of opinion as to which is the
better for general table use. The
reports for last year clearly prove
that the Green Mowntain Is the best
variety for the general farmer. Seed
of these two Varieties from three dif-
ferent sources—Northern~ Ontario,
New Brunswick and ‘Old Ontario—
has been experimented with and
Planted in clay and sand in nearby
districts in different parts of the pro-
vince. These show the following
average yields per acre:

Irish. Cobbler—Northern Ontario,
153.4; New Brunswick, 148; Old
Ontario, 127. ;

Green Mountain—Northern , Op-
tario, 177.5; New Brunswick, 137.3;
Old Ontario, 164.8.

The general average per acre on
the different plots was:

   

Irish Cobbler planted in\ sand;
151.5, .and on clay, 126.1, which

shows a yield of 25.4 bushels more
to the acre from seed planted on
sand.

Green Mountain planted on sand,
169.3, and 153.2 bushels planted on
clay, a yield of 16.1 more bushels
per acre fromsséed planted on sand.

The results when the yields from

SPRING FEVER 38

Following Colds, Grippe, Thin,
Woetey of Pole mei

~ (By De. Varentnve Morr.) ;

‘At this time of year most people sufs
fer from what we term “spring fever™
because of a stagnant condition of the
blood, because of the toxic poisong
stored up within the body during thd ,
long winter, Wo cat too much meat,
with little or no green vegetables,
Bloodless people, thin, anemic people,
those with pale cheeks and lips, wlio
have a poor appetite and_feel that tired,
worn or feverish condition in the spring~
time of the year, should try the refresh
ing tonic powers of a good alterative
and blood purifier. Such a tonic as drug-
gists have sold for fifty years, is Doctor
Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It
is a standard remedy that can be ob-

tained-in tablet or liquid form. Made

without alcohol from wild roots and
barks.

Occasionally one should “clean house™
with castor oil ortiny pills made up, of
the May-apple, leaves of_aloe and jalap,
and sold by almost all druggist thi
country as Doctor Pierce’s casant
Pellets.

Sarnia, Ont.—"I was in a very bad
condition. I could not eat without *feel-
ing distr@szed, Had indigestion so badly
I was always. in misery, I had liver
trouble as well; and the two Just put mo

‘down and out’ for about fiye years. ¥
had mahy good doctors but got no relief.
I took Doctor Plérce's Golden Medical
Discovery and before IT had taken two
bottles [ was much improved, and in less
than six months I was well. I could eat
anything and do my work with pleasure.”

ESSEX COUNTY COUNCIL,
Auditors’ Report.

fo the Finance Committee of the County of Essex: —
Gentienien,—In compliance with the direction of the Chairman of your

committee that we report on the County Registrar's report to thea County
in relation to the division of the surplus of fees,of his oltice tor 1918, between
him and the municipalities, and a comparison with the report for 1917.

We beg to report as folldows:—
We find under the amendments to the Registry Act, 1918, that the fees

to the office ror registrations was’ materially increased, for example it now
ovusts to register a wortgage an increase of Suc. a deed 0c., a certificate 26c.,
a plan $4.00, discharge of mortgage 5Uc., letters of administration 60c., etc.,
And the division of, the surplus was changed in the Act from a percentage
om gross and net income to percentage on net reco{pts only.

The gross receipts for the year 1918 were $15,016.95 and for 1917 were
$22,624.85, an increase for 1918 over that of 1917 of $2,372.10, notwithstanding
Ahab there were 74 more instruments registered in’1917 than in 1918,

Under the division of the surplus as provided by the amendment of 1918
the municipalities were paid $5,329.70; if the Act had not been changed in
respect to the division of the surplus the municipalities would have received
$6,089.33, or $759.63 more.

Under the amendment the Registrar received for himself $4,592.19; if
the division tad not been changed by the Act he would have received $3,832,-
66; or $759.68 less. By a provision of the amended Act tho deduction from
the gross income for the expenses connected with the work in conducting
the busimess of the office stat! not be increased beyond the amount paid there-
Yor in 1917 without the consent in writing of the Inspector.

The expenses of the office in 1918 were $5,096.06, and for 1917 were
$4,754.26, an increase for 1918 of $349.81. The expenses of 1918,, $6096.06, was
used in the deductions to arrive at the net income for 1918.

; The Registrar has not received the consent of the Inspector thereto_ss
tae aequired by the Act, but he says he will do so at once.
From the above you will observe that although there was not as much
business done in 1918 as in 1917, yet the receipts were 2,372.10 more, and that
st qhe munieipa)ities*got $732.93 more and the Registrar gat $1,299.36 more than
eed 4n 1917 and the expenses were $349.81 more.

Attached hereto ig a comparative statement of the instruments registered

and other receipts for the years 1917 and 1918 from which you can make your

own comparisons,

ill to accomplish this end. He
plained that the change” was being
made owing to the clumsy nature of
the present lekal tender. A sugges:
tion was; made ‘by Sin Herbert Ames
that there should be a two-cent piece.
Sir Thomas thought that*for the pres-
ent this was unnecessary.

Sir Thomas said that thé present coin
weighs eighty pennies to the pound,
while the new coin will rem 140 to the
pound. It will approximate the Amer>
fean bronze cent, which “weighs 48
gains It willbe a little lighter than
the 10-cent silver piéce and figure so
that it will be easily distinguished by
the touch.

The old*one-cent piece will continue
{n force and the new one will be: js-
sued by proclamation.

Sir_Thomas explained that it was not
intended to withdraw the present one-
eent piece from circulation,” but as
they became smooth and worn they
would be redeemed. This would take
a long time

Mr. Jacobs suggested that the new
coins. should be more distinctively
Canadian than those at present.

THE BEST VARIETIES OF GRAIN |

For many years the Dominion Ex
perimentaal Farms”and Stations have
been conducting tests in the yarjous
provinces to determine the bew, varie-
ties of cereal crops for cuwtiivation in
Canada. In Circular No, 16 {ssued by
the Cereal] Division, and diistributed by
the Publications Branch off the Depart-
ment of Agriculturesat Ottawa, the
merits of the leading warieties are
discussed and such information given
as will be a guide to farnuers in select-
ing the varieties to sow this spring.
After a general discuswiion of the var-
jeties the -best kinds ame arranged. ap-
proximately in the order of merit-for
the different-parts of Canada? Wheats
are: divided into six classes. Follow-
Ing are the leading warieties {n each
class: Fall wheat, Dawson's Golder
Chaff; spring wheat, law ripening,
Red Fife; early ripening, ~ Marquis;
very early, Ruby; extrenjejly early,
Prelude, Durum, Kubanka. These sey-
