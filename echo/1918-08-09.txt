BEST TOOLS FOR GARDEN

Laying fens Are More Profitable
Than Ever. *

Frequeat Change of Pasture Protects
Lambs from Disease and Ensure
Steady Gains — Annual Pasture
Has Proven Satisfactory.

Agriculture, Toronto.)

OST gardeners use a hoe,
rake, spade, and diggiug
fork in their gardens, The
three last are used chiefly

during spring preparation of the soll
and again in the fall during tho huar-
vesliug of the crop.‘ The hoe,” how.
ever, is used almost all summer,
Most people in Suying tools simply
take what is offeged, never consider-
ing that in using the heavier types
sold in many stores much eneygy ts
spent in handling these, that could
be used more profitably in doing
| other garden work, Besldes, it ia ex-

pected that women and children will
do much of the garden work this sea-
son and it is necessary to give them
implements suited to their strength,

+For these reasons it has been urg-
ed on the gardeners to. buy a hoe
called the triangle, onion or beet hoe,
with a cutting edge 414 inches wide,
This hoe is light to‘handle and does
very satisfactory Work, especially
close {n around the plants in the
row, With it should bo used the
“Buco” type of cultivator with the
two outside tynes removed. These
two tools will do better work thaa
any of the ordindry hoes with a great
deal less expenditure of strength and
jn shorter time.

Where one has a larger garden,
say 60x 100 feet, it will’ be well to
invest in a wheel hoe to help out the
two above-mentioned tools, With the
“Buco” to make.a deeper mulch af-
ter a heavy rain or continuous tramp-
ing over the soll], the Bmallvhoe for
close weeding, the wheel hoe makes
{t much easier to maintain a good
mulch during; the dry season, thus
consérving moisture and advancing
Plant growth.—A. H. .MacLennan,

THRESHING IN ONTARIO

A Proposed Plan of Organization—
How to Overcome the Difficulties
—Applications: to He Filed a9
Once, ;

(Contributed by Ontario Department of
Agriculture. Toronto.)

HE threshing gang is not

an untried experiment in

Ontario. In certain coun-

’ ties, Lambton for instance,

‘these gangs have been employed and
| have proven very successful. Neither
;the threshermen nor the farmer in
these cases care to return.to the old

methods of changing help with neigb-

| bors where men for the threshing
Bangs can be secured. Thé -Ontario

| Tangements to ensure an ample sup-

Dly of labor for as many threshing
fangs as are likely to be organized

of organizing a gang and a plan of
Organization.

The Difficultits—Overcome Them.

(1,) In the early part of harvest
when many moves must be made and
when cOmparatively small dmounts
of graim are threshed, the thresher-
man finds it dificult, often, to make
& probit even under present methods.
If he employs a gang his expenses
will be much beavier. His charges
therefore must be high enough so
that later jn the season he may re-
iin what is ‘lost at this time,

But at any time during the

ng season there may» be con-
idleness during thé {fre-
changes from farm to farm
by the camparatively small

his lost time may be limited

each thresher td provide a sleeping

if the thresher does his own bullding.
Nothing ornate ts required. A struc!
ture 10 feét wide by 12 feet long,
built on trucks, wind-proof and rain-
proof and with two tlérs of bunks
on each side would afford ample
sleeping accommodation for an-On-
tario gang

(5.) As several men const{tute'a
fang the weekly wage sheet would
rug fairly high. This would {nyolve
a ‘considerable regutar expenditure
on the part of the thresher, which in
turn would necessitate prompt pay-
ment. by fasmers; Where gangs are
employed, it Iu necessary for farmers
to give cash-or 30-day notes imme-
diately the job is done, ? A

(¢.)° Probably the most important
factor of all is the rates which the
thresher will charge, These must, of
course, be much higher than, those
charged formerly, This would make

year in Ontario, and the “fire loss per
capita* was $6, compared with 25c in
Puropean countries.

In?order to meet difficulties that
have arisen in connection with the
securing of ingredients for the new
standard “dairy feed, the agricultural
section of the Ontario Resources Com-
mittee has approved of changes in the
formula which, without materially af-
fecting the feeding value of the pre-

new formula calls for 48 per cont. of

per cont. Originally fixed. Not more
than 20 per cent. of the feed may be

content from 24 to 22 per cent.

Ned sped away with the prescription.
He returned with a steaming jar. Deft

the medicine. In five minutes old Snow-

though he fully comprehended his at-
tention, and hen he at length gained
his feet he lovingly laid his cheek
against Paul's shoulder.

They¥ became great friends, those
three. Then’ a new token of interest
came into Paul Dacre’s lifé. He natur:
nily met Alma ond they became quite
friendly. Head-strong, erratic, ne’er-
do-well as he was, there was some-
thing beautiful in his love for Ned and
old Snowfoot. Paul did odd Jobs in the
town, but every morning he was on
hand to help Ned get over his route,

As to Alma, he idolized her, and tald
her so, “Some day I'll make a fortune,”
he declared, “Ill make you all rich
and you'll.have so maby suitors you
can pick some prince or major general
for thé husband you deservé."»

And now Paul, homeward bound,
was surrounded by a crowd of juvenile
admirers. He pretended to whisper in
Snowfoot's — epr. Immediately the
clever animal he’ had trhined in old-
time cireuy tricks started runbing
around in a ring. - Paul described a
running jump, to Innd squarely upon
the back of the horse. A dozen times
they sped around the ring. Then Paul
made Snowfoot steal a bandkerchiet
from his pocket, locnte*a hidden ear
of corn and nod his head seven times
when asked how many days there.were ‘|
in the week. are ’

Paul stood spellbound with dread
and doubt, when, late the next after-
noon, he went up to the house to ac
company Ned gn his evening delivery
rounds, Ned was seated on the step
of the wagon, a picture of disconsolate

“Hi, there!” suddenly rang out @
frightful yell aloft. Within a flashing | 66
second of time the scene was one of in-

describable confusion. The fusing lamp
of one of the overhead Workers had ex-
ploded. The dripping contents had
scattered everywhere; up aloft the
whole inside rain @yorlo was ablaze
The burning lquid,"dropping to the
floor, had set o great heap of shavings,
block and bench frames on fire,

Paul chanced to be near the stage.
As he saw on impassable barrier of fire
shut off the entire front end of the
butiding he heard the vain shouts of
the agonized father, pee back
the ¢ no of fire, pleading for &
rescue of his darling child: The beick
wall behind the stage was solid. The
fire was advancing to lick up the new.
framework, Paul ran to the child.

“Little one,” he said hurriedly, “for
papa’s sake will you do just as I say?
If I set you on my back with your arms

@round my nféck, will you hold fast—
fast?”

“But won't I burn?’

“You won't burn, darling. You shall.
be safe with your fathor in a jiffy, if
you just hold on and never let go.”

It was well thaf the old skill of his
one-time, trapeze experience held Paul
Dacre in good stead now. The lrtle
one kept her word like a Trojan. She
did not even. whisper as, half way up
one of the long ropes, a sweep of cin-
ders came against them like a blast.
Then they were at the rafters. Seizing
a board,-Paul smashed ont «a broad.
sash. Now they were on the roof. Hd
drew up the eighty-odd feet of rope,
let it trail down over the roof, and
inch by inch descended down the slant,
over the edge, and the gathered crowd
cheered and grouped about the hero:
rescuer and the little child.

Paul Dacre did not have to steal

He
could have redeemed the animal had it
taken thousands, for the father of the
little Evalime could .not suMciently
show his gratitude. Hoe offered Paul
the charge of a stock farm at a high
salary. He even came down to the
Brayton home to visit him. And’ Alma
began to see the nobleness of charac.
ter in the ex-circus rider. And little
Evaline was showing Alma how she
had clung to Paul the day of tho fre,
and putting out her hands drew the
face of Alma close to her own.
* And’as it nestled there, the chubby
hand drew that of Paul in loving con-
tact, and Alma’s eyes “met those of
Paul, and the revelation of perfect love
was complete.

Lumber Raft to Cross Sea.

One-of the marvels'of the age, ac-
cording to the marine authorities, an
invention which will make possible the
towing of 216,000 cubic feet of lumber
safely acroas the Atlantic ocean, has
been completed at a provincial port.

No»matter how severe the storms or
how dangerous the undertaking, the
big raft is so constructed that it will,
be able to make the long trip without
any possibility of loss or damage. Most
of the machinery used in this tnitial
craft can be used over again, and so

close. to $80,000, will not affect the |
business end of the undertaking.

The lumber, sald to be sorely needed
on the other side, is valued at $150,000,
The big raft has been under construc~
tion for several months, 70 men being:
