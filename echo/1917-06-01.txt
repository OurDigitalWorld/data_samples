AIR BRAKES AND TOILETS -

F FOR AMHERSTBURG CARS
; Act ES

| An interesting session of the On-
tario Railway and Muncipal Board was
held at the city hall, Windsor, Tues-
day, when Chairman D, M. McIntyre
and Commissioner A. B. Ingram heard
the application of Essex county ond
other municipalities to compel the S.,
W. & A. olectric railway management
to insta) alr brakes and toilet © con-
Veniences on the’ cars running from
Amherstburg to Tecumseh. A fight
for these concessions hag been going
on for years, and from time to time
applications were made to the Ontario
Railway Board for an order to compel
the Company to act, and it was gener-
@ily understood that an order had
been given and ignored, but this was
not the fact. '

However, after hearing
dente Tuesday, the Board ordered
Mr. Anderson, Manager, to instal both
fir brakes and conveniences within
the next 6ix months, >
: Mr, Anderson explained that he had
fome time ago ordered the air brake
equipment, which would’ have been on
before now bat for the delay in pro-
curing some of the, parts. The mat-
ter of toiléta will-take same time .as
new and larger cara will be necessary.
Mr. Anderson’s evidence went to: show
that the cars uséd were light ones,
and there had nevor been an accident
due to the fact that hand brakes were
uded, °

The toilet accessories now in vogue
both,,for employees and passengers
came up for discussion and the elabor-
ate public toflet, erected by’ Windsor
‘near the S., W. & A. waiting room
there, was ronsted as being unsani-
itary and il) kept.

Barrister A. R. Bartlet appeared
for the street railway company; Bar-
riater Fleming for Ojibway, and Bar-
rister Rodd for the County of Bssex.

—If they can do it in Thamesville,
why not-elsewhere? Here is what the
Thamesville Herald says:—"The local
bakers raised the price of bread to
12c, per loaf last week. The reeve
thought, in view of the fact that flour
had taken a drop, that. this was too
high; and was going to be a hardship
to many people. He also had an offer
from an outside baker to deliver bread
to the stores here at’9c a loaf, Mr.
McKenzie took the matter up with
the local bakers, with the result that
they have agreed to keep the price at
10c. In fairness to our bakers it
should be understood that one of them
has liad difficulty in getting a baker,
and has therefore been seriously
handicapped.”

—A quiet wedding took place in St:
Paul's church, Essex, on Sunday even-
ing-of last week when Miss Harriet L.
Oldfield, daughter of Mr. and Mrs, W.
Oldfield, of Essex, was united in mar.
riage to Sergt. Lyman Day Root, of
Walkerville, the attendants being the
parents of the bride. Sergt. Root, who
i8 a native of New) York, has been en-
gaged with Major T.-B. Balfour in re-
cruiting in Amherstburg and Windgor
district for some time past. Priofi to
enlisting -he-waa employed in thetauto
works in Walkerville. Sergt. Root ex-
pects to leave shortly with a Canadian
battalion for overseas service. He has
many friends in Amherstbutg who
wish him, and his bride hearty good
luck and prosperity.

—-Dr..W, €. Lambert,
Wyandotte, is Strongly in favor of.
“Wyandotte’s Own" unit, instead ‘of
having the young men of the city en-
list Jn Detroit. “Theres not likely to
be a big lot of speech making in|}
Wyandotte, but the men of -the clty
will respond to the @all," he said.
“They are thorough |
the women of the city are anxious to}
be of service. I know they feel that
they could do more
they knew the unit was intact, and
together. The fact would facilitate}
reaching them with the comforts the
women intend to prepare.’ A unit from |
Wyandotte would be a boost for the |
city, and would be in the best inter-}
egts ofthe boys themselves,”

—The amendment to the Ontario
Temperance Act, which was Made a
law at the last Session of the Legisla-
ture, empowering Ifquor inspectors to
Serve notice on persons beliaved to
drinkgto excess, has been applied for |
the first.time to J. Béattie, of Leam- |

mayor of

ington, The new act forbids excessive}
users of intoxicants to drink or. have |
liquor in their possession, and as well
makes transportation companies Hable |
for delivering liquor to the person |
served by notice. The liquor, if con-
signed to @ person already served by
notice, must be delivered to the In-
Spector, who deals with the affair ac-
cordingly. J. EB. Stone, license Inspec-
tor for South Essex,*served notice on
Beattle and his wife Ingt week. The
act permits*the acensed sto appeal!
against “such notice. Judge J. O.
Dromgole, to whom Beattie appealed,
adjourned the case for six months, be-
cause a third party, a brother of Beat-

A Well Known Resident of Port

Hawkesbury is Restored to |
Health and Strength

One of the best known men in the
town of Port Hawkesbury, N. S,. is
William Duff. He hog been a member
of the municipal council for 14 years,
chairman of the school board, and held
other responsible positions, Mr,
Duff's words, therefore, can be taken
48 coming from a man -who bay the
esteem and respect of his fellow-
townsmen. He makes no 8C6ret of
the fact that he believes Dr, Wiiliams’
Pink Pills saved his life, and’ that they
restored him to good health, after
several medical men had falloa to
cure him.. Mr. Duff tells of his ill-
ness and cure as follows: "About
four years ago I was attacked With la
Brippe which left me in a cOfidition
difficult to describe. 1 was attacked
with general weakness, ond 4 con-
stant dull pain in the stomach. 1 be-
came 80 weak that I could not Walk
one hundred yards without Sitting
down to rest. The food I ate contin-
ually soured on my stomach. My
nerves were all gone, and palpitation
of the heart and a fluttering senua-
tion all through my chest, especially
at night was almost unbearable. I
was finally compelled to go to body
and called in a doctor, who said my
heart was affected, and treated me for
that trouble. After three Months -at-
tendance, and feeling no better I call-
ed in another doctor. His treatment
also fafléd to help me, and | tried a
third doctor. This one said there was
nothing wrong with my heart,that the
trouble was due to my stomach. - Af-
ter treating me for a time he advised
that I go to the hospital at Halifax,
On a previous occasion when I had an
attack of rheumatism I had been cur-
ed by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and 1
decided that rather than BO to a hos-
pital T*would again try this medicine,
I-got a supply of the pills and began
taking them. In a few weeks I could
feel my strength returning, my stom-
ach was giving me less trouble, the
palpitation ‘of the heagt disappeared;
and after a further use of the pille I
felt as well as ever I did in my life,
T can truly say that I feel more thank.
ful. than words can express for wliat
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have done
for, me,”

You can get these pills from any
dealer in medicine, or by mail at 50
cents a box, or six boxes for $2.50
from The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,
Brockville, Onj.
