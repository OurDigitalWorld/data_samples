FOR SALE—Ojie of the best 55-acre on main id, ood house, barn, erainery,

Hest of soil, wel fenced, well. drained, 11. acres meidow; 5 acres good A statement has béendssyed by thé
some of ‘the fall plowing done; new bun- vat; rest plowed for spring work, Dominidn Government reviewing its

activities in ‘enforcing the various
regulations respecting enemy property
Jand enemy business dealings in’ Can-
ada. It is pointed out that’ since the
consolidated orders respecting trading
with thesenemy were passed, the De-
partment of the Se@retary of State
has made nimerous investigitions, in-

property or déalings which have been
brought to its attention. If many in-
stances’ chartered ‘accountants have
been engaged to. investigate and sub-
mit reports, and among the list» of
firms- whose businesges were thus in-
vestigated are.the,different companies
in which Alvo von Alvensleben, of Van-
couver, was interested.

In addition, the Finance Department
has been engaged in carrying out the
j Provisions of the orders, in collecting
pmcnerE registering enemy properties
in Canada and claims of debts due by
| persons in enemy countries to Can-
;adians, and vice. versd. These claims
[are now being déalt with by the Enemy
|Debts Committee, and particulars of
the claims are being forwarded to
Canada’s representatives at the Peace
Conference. :

 

 

SMALL SAVINGS DESIRED.

 

Despise not the day of small things
—Iis the advice the soundness of which
has always been recognized. In na-
tional finance this,holds es true as in
other departments of life. So one sees
the nations generally making it easy
for their people to save because {t is
jredlized that by the savings of the
masses the national financial edifice
may be made secure. The Dominion
Government has launched a War Say-
ings plan that is framed to promote
saving among all classes of Canad-
{ans. By this method money may be
lent to the Government through the
Purchase’ of a War Savings Stamp at
$4. for which $5 will be repaid by.the
Governmeny in January, 1924. This
menas thi 42 Money, thus invested
draws Mi over 4% per cent. com-
pounde ‘yearly. As behind these,
‘}stamps stands all Canada, one can
readily see that the security -is un-
questioned. If Canadians do not be-
come a saving people it. will not be
through Inck of opportunity, or induce-

ment, to save. ,

rid the town of the typhoid menace,
Analysis of the water recently showed
that it was again becoming contamin-

for domestic use. The present plant
would have to be kept in working or-

working properly; When no further
need for it, he advocated dismantling
the old plant and selling the machin-
ery, but believed that town should re-
tain the property. The bullding could
be utilized as a club house’ and dress-
ing room for bathers, and thé water
lot converted into a civic swimming
pool. They had laid in a large supply.
of coal, which would be available. in
