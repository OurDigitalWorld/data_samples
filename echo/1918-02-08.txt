Marat's Deadly Prescription.

Whether Marat of “the terror” wasa
veterinary surgeon or a fusblonable
physician is -n-polnt which historians
have earnestly debated. Some lght 1s
thrown upon it by the memolfs of tho
papal envoy of the period, who was
one of his patients, and reports as fol-
lows;

“He prescribed for me some medl-
cine which would have killed me if
the celebrated chemist of the Rue
Jacob had been willing to give it to
me. ‘I see well enough,’ he said, ‘that
this 4s no medicine for you: it is medl-
cle for a horse. I recognize.the doc-
tor’s signature; he {s mad.’ Apparently
Marat had mistaken me for one of his
patients at the stable at which he evas
a physician.” t

The Modest Model.
Julia Ward Howe, though a woman

of very good appenrance, was extreme-

“Don't be afraid; I'll do you justice,
madam.’

“Ah, she answered, ‘It isn’t jugtice

Functioning Without Discomfort.

About three years ago I chanced to pick up a copy of the magazine,
“Physical Culture,” and read an article written by a business woman who -
claimed to have trained herself into health befitting her dutiog, and out of
the physical infrmatives so common to’ women in all phases of life during

their most efficient years.

These infirmitiea are so common as to be accepted as a traditional
neceasity. They are used as-one of the most common arguments showing
why women can never compete wholly with men in work or business, and
therefore can never be estimated by the same wage or salary scale.

I decided to work out a plan I could recommend to any woman patients”
to carry through theae physical phases with the least possible evidence to

others and discomfort to themselves.

In the three years-of observation I

am’ able to state that with the intelligent woman who will co-operate with

me I have had astounding results.

“My observations cover'the girla and women employed in stores and
factories, the office women in positions where the tension on nerves is more
marked because of greater responsibilities, and the Women in professional
life or in business for themselves where the nerve tension is greater still,

THE STARTING POINT

Blocd Rich, Red and Pure.

Week, watery blood is the starting
point of consumption. When your
blood {s in this condition your whole
health declines.” Your face becomes
pale or sallow; your appetite fails, your
heart jumps and* flutters at the least
exertion or excitement. You are al-
ways weak and wretched and. you lose
interest in both work and amusement.
This is the point from which you may
easily> step Into that hopeless decline
that leads to consumption and the
grave. What is needed to bring back
health, strength and energy is the
new, rich red blood Dr, Williams’ Pink
Pills actually make. In all the world
of medicine there 1s no other tonic
and blood builder-like them; and all
who. feel weak, run-down or easily tired
should loge no time in giving these
pile a fair trint They. have trans-
formed thousands of wenok, hopeless

~ Announcing —
. the new
bigger
Comfort bar

Gamfort Soap ie now a much bigger bar. It's the

syne soap absolutely, but we are giving you a larger

bax for the game money. We do this because we are withdrawing all
premiums as it is now impossible to get satisfactory premium goods
ewing to the war.

No premiums but more soap

Dozens of premium-making factories are now making war supplies, Qthers
cannot ship, being across the ocean. ° The new premiums offered us are
away under-Comfort Soap standards so when our present stock of premiums is
exhausted we will not issue any more—certainly not until after the war.

Gentlemen,—Your Keeper-begs leave to report as.followa:—~ |

Our crops on the farm were very good, considering the bad year. There
was quite a bi€f the crop cut or pulled before it was ripe, as we had’ to, go

s$ 747.80 through it with tiling machine. We had four hundred: bushels of potatoes-—

e L riiséd ten huntred andjseventy bushels of corn, four hundred*and fifty bush-

We alko recommend the purchase: of the adding’ Machine’ wow on’ ex- | undred and theee-bushels of onions, about twenty-five bushels of*turnfps, six
hundred henda of cabbage, three hundréd bushels of oats, and,three tons of

hay.

We tiled the farm every seventy foet, according to:the Government plans,
at h cost of elx hundred -and-ten dollars and sixty-five cénts for the tile,
forty-four dollars and ninety-seven cents freight on tile; cost of putting in
the tile was five hundred and eighty-four dollars and seventy-six cents, mak-
ing @ total of twelve hundred and forty dollars and. thirty-elght*cents, which
1 am sure will-{mprove the farm greatly. The outlet for the tile, Sturgeon
Creek, will have to be-cleaned out in the spring or as Soon-as pogsible or the
tile will not give good results. ’ ~ .

We hnd to take down all cross fences on farm for tiling machine, and
have put 81mo up/in good shape, We'put up one hundred rods ofi new fence
cn west line north'of the raflroad, and new fence around cemetery. ‘

We drew dirt and ‘filled up all the holes in the marsh and have same all
plowed but about three-quarters ‘of an acre, 4

We constructed cement steps at front entranc® of house, this year, at a

Methodist General Conference of 1914,
a referendum vote is to be taken at
the quarterly board eting of all
Methodist churches in “Canada upon
the question of extending, or eliminat-

in favor of it, what change would you
suggest? At present no pastor can
occupy a pulpit for longer than four
years. There is a strong agitation for
® change’ The matter was taken 0

by the Board of Wesley church, Sun-

cast against any change in the pres-
