We rodo on together for another ten
Miles, when tho girl began to gather
her belongings. Thank heavy ‘en, she was
preparing to alight! Truo cnough,
When the next station, Talbotsy illo,
Was announced by the brakeman the
young Indy arose from her seat and
moved to the door, She had scarcely
feached {t before | changed my seat for
the one she had left and begun my
search,

T looked on the seat. 1 looked on the
floor, I lit a match to seo better whilo
hunting beneath. No pin was to be
seen. I examined the alse between the
seat I had occupied and that on which
tho girl had sat. 1 was doomed to dis:
appointment,

I now suspected that she bad my pin.

I left the train at the next station,
took a cab and rode back to Talbots-
ville, There I visited the two news-
Paper offices of the place and left an
advertisement at each stating that a
mosaie scarfpin had been Jost on a cor-
tain train and the finder would be prop-
erly rewarded for its return; no ques-
tions asked. Then I went to my home,
having left instructions at the offices of
the papers to send me aby replies that
might Come for me,

A couple of days Inter I received a
letter signed Julia Waterman stating
that sho had found a mosuie se: artpin
on the train mentioned. As to “no
questions asked,” the finder of the pln
would ask the questions. She would
return the pin without reward after
the loser had explained how he came to
lose It,

My suspicion of an amused smile was
now explained. The girl bad bad my
pin all the while 1 was looking for tt.
It was evident that I must confess, I
wrote Miss Waterman that’no girl with
such kissablo lips should be permittéa
to travel on any traln that passed
through ‘a tunnel, for they offered an ir-
resistiblo temptation... I was quite will-
ing to give my pin, though it was a
gift from my dear mother, for the kiss
Thad taken, It grew sweeter each day
in my memory. If she would accept
the one in’ Jieu of the other 1 would
consider the account closed,

The next day I recovered my acarf-
pin by express and a note saying that
the writer had no kisses to dispose of
in exchange for anything. She resery-
ed the right to give her kisses to whom-
Soever she might choose. Not another
word did she write, There was no de-
mand for an apology or for a confes-
sion from me that 1 bad committed a
Wrong. What I didn't like about It
Was that it closed the incident.

Now, I did not propose thatit should
be closed. 1 wished to form thé young
Jady's acquaintance with a view to got-
ting another kiss. One more? No; a
doven, A dozen? No; a hundred, a
thousand, ten thousand, But how re-
open tho matter? I mst invent some
plan. Almost any plan would do, pro-
vided the young lady would.be pleased
fo mako my acquaintances No pilin
would suffice if she desired thitt the
matter be dropped. In otber words, I
might be:the gainer by pushing on, and
if I,did not push on I would certainly
be a loser.

I wrote her that I would be glad to
explate my robbery by giving her my
scarfpin, but since she would not. ac-
cept itein éxchange for what. I had
taken, I would be only too gind to do-
nate it or its value to.any charity she
might. designate..__2 bia swould. nok she
disposing of the kiss\for her own bene-
fit, but for the rellef of the needy.
With this note 1 sent the scatfpin:
The*offer without the pin would have
been useless. By sending the pin I
forced her to take another step.

When aywoman gives way to a per-
sistent admirer, she is apt to do so all
of a sudden. Miss Waterman replicd
to my note in a very different yein than
before. She wrote*mo that I had be-
hayed very well in atoning for my
faujt. As to what sliovld be done with
tho pin, perbaps we had better talk tho
matter over. ‘She would be pleased to
have’me call.upon her for the purpose
on a certain evening,

when he saw’a certain maneuver of

Miss Watcrman must have regretted

country are not to be compared with
those of Europe, especially the remark-
ablo ones made by the peasants of It-

aly and of the Tyrol. In tho latter
country there has been of recent years
a decided revival of interest in these
groups representing tho nativity of
Christ.

eral hundred figures. Not alono the
birth of the Saviour, but the adoration
of the shepherds, the arrival of tho
kings with thelr soldiers and courtiers,
tho flight into Egypt, Jesus in the tem.
ple, and ‘even tho marriage at Cana
are represented.

Tho Tyrol’s cribs have been famous
for centuries, and the peoplo were just.
ly proud of them untll the spirit of
“modern enlightenment’ invaded the
Jand and crib building was denounced
as child’s play. Enterprising antiqua.
rians and art sellers eagerly bought up
a)! tho old cribs and then sold them at
00d profit to tourists.

Many fine specimens bare disappear.
cd from the land, bot fortunately a
few of the best were acquired by na-
tional museums, Tho best two Tyrol ts
known to have had, the “Ursulinen-
krippe” of Innsbruck and the Moser
erib of Bozen, aro now in the Bavarian
National museum at Munich. A third,
the Jdufenthaler crib, is In tho Vienna
museum,

Originally-it belonged to a familyin
Wilten, now a part of Innsbruck. It
contained 154 anima) figures, 24 bulld-
inga and 256 human figures. It in-
eluded solid woodcarvings, figures the
heads of which wero wax and others
whose heads and Jimbs were movable.
Some of theso date back aos far aa the
year 1700, Seven scenes were repre-
sented.

The Moser erfb of Bozen was much
more extensive. Moser’s “city” was in
itself a masterplece and included pa)-
aces, gushing fountains, monuments
of Wing David and towers with six
city clocks striking the-hours of the
night. It was valued at more than
$5,000 during Moser's lifetime.

The Ursulines’ crib was particularly
famous on account of the gorgeous
dressing of the figures. The angels
Were clad os courtiers of heaven in
the rich court costumes of thé seven-
teenth century.

Theso masterpieces aré now lost to
Tyrol. It can hardly cause surprise,
then, that serious minded men began
to entertain grave fears for their re-
maining works of art. This fear had a
practical result in the formation of «
society whose object was te prevent in
Tuture the \reckless exportation apd
selling of old cribs and to revive tho
spirit that produced them.

Tyrolese eribs may be divided Into
two general classes, the oriental type
and the Tyrolese. In tho latter er

is uncertain, it is not impossible. We
may infer ‘t*at a true knowledge of
the site of Jesus’ burial and resur-
Tection also, was Preserved by local
time when
Aelin Capitolina was founded. When
the new city had been built, and
some, if not all, of the -old- Innd- ‘a
tion would become liable to varia-
tion and vagueness, But we find
that in A.D. 326, nearly two hundred
years after, the rebuilding of Jeru-
salem, the Christinns of the locality
have a perfectly definite notion of the
place of the Holy Tomb. They know
that it is concealed by the mound on
which the Temple of Venus stood,

the traditional identifications since
