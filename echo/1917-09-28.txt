No. ‘13, which he had entered in the

George H. Fullington, aged 40, a De-
troit automobile agent, met instant
death at tho Windsor race track Son-

‘}day afternoon’ when his machine be-

came uncontroliable*and dashed into
the fence. Fullington’s head was
caught by thé top rail of the fence
just below the chin and he was-prac-
tically decapitated.

The tragedy was witnessed by the
victim's 13-year-old daughter, who was
seated in the grandstand watching her
father as he sped nround the mile
oval at ever-increasing speed. After
0 laps Fullington stopped and let out
liis mechanician, intending to make
the last miles-with less weight in the
machine. Rounding the back stretch
the car was observed to leavo the
centre of the track and make a dash

lieved the steering gear parted under
the Strain created by ‘centrifugal force
at the turn and the man was unable
to even slightly divert the conrae of
his machine. So great was the force
of the impact that nine stout wooden
posts were snapped’'dff before the
automobile.camie to a standstill.’ Ful-

came to attend the Missionary Con-
vention. The function of this meet-
ing i8 to discuss. ways and means of
raising! the’ needed money for the
various ‘funds of the church.

Rev. Dr Joho Graham, secretary of
Education, was’ present; and gave a
telling address In the work of educa-
tion in Victoria College, and after
earnest appeal, it
was decided to set apart February
10th, 1918, as fleld day to raise funds
for this work. Dr. Graham stated that
Victoria College was facing a big
deficit because of the fact that.so
many young men had‘enlisted, and in
order t) meet the contingencies in the
case, it was considered nécessary to
raise at least $70,000 this year

Rev. J. H. Arnup, B. Aj assistant)
secretary of Foreign Missions, and o
modern Demosthenes, gave an ifllum-
inating address on Methodist missions.
Rev. G. N. Hazen, the  atatistician,
gave in tabiiinted form the status of
miastonary effort jon each circuit dur-
ing the past two years. It was shown
that the London Conference con-
tributed $95.000 to missions last year,
an incréase of more than $6,000 over
the preceding year. The objective for
this year is $115,000, and in order to
help. meet this amount the Windsor

GRANDEES OF SPAIN:

Curious Hat Etiquette That Marke ~
Their Three Cladeda, 2%

A grandee of Spain enjoys the privi.
lege, granted him muny hondreds of
years ago, of remuining “covered” in
the presence of his sovereign. This
custom dates from the period when,
according to the theory then held, ‘the
king was “the first among equals,” _ a

The nuclent formula always at the
coronation of thé kings of old Spain
was, “We, your equals, choose you to
reign over us,” And the king assented
{n this declaration of his nobles,

There was a time when all grundees
of Spain wore thelr bats in the pres.
ence of the king, but in time the idea
of caste began to prevail even am:
the grandees, with the result that they. _
Were eventually divided into three ~
classes, and ‘these classes wero distin.
guished by the hat etiquette.

The first class entered the royal ppps-
ence covered; the second clasa entered

ject. “The Government should be pe-
titioned by the people of Essex for
the establishment of a home in the

{s no better site In Western Ontario
for such an institution thanvon the
shore of Lake Erie, near Kingsville
or Ledmington.” This matter has
been mentioned more than once ‘in

Maldén was suggested as the 0n@} j)jes in Canada waste one slice of
site especially suitable both from] white bread per weék. For conven-

fence we will consider that the one,
pound loaf divides into fourteen slices
of 1.1402. each. The sum, js simple.

1 slice of bread (1/14 of loaf) weighs
1.14 oz. If one million families waste
one slice -per week, the weekly total
waste of bread is 1,140,000 0z., or
74,250 one-pound loaves, or enough
for 21/3 divisions for one day, or one
division (21,500 menn’ for 313 days, or
10 meals to eath man.

The annual national waste rising
from the same source js impressive.
Annual totc) result of 1,000,000 fam-
ilies wasting 1 slice of bread per
week—3,705,000 one-pound loaves; or
2593,500 Ths. flour; or 3,572,000. Ths.
wheat; or 59,244 bushels wheat.

The tremendous importance of
waste prevention and of food economy
is clear. It: is appropriate to touch
Briefly on a subject that, “im these
times of war, js equally vital—the pos-
sibilities of substituting other staples
for wheat flour. "]

If, once a week, one million Can-
adian families use a one-pound loaf
of..corn, or rye bread instead of @
similar loaf of white, the weekly and
yearly saving would be:

Substituting one-pound loaf or corn,
or rye, biead per week would save—
1,000,000 tbs. of white bread; or 700,
000'tbs. of floor; or 3,571 bbls. of flour;
or 16,070 bushels of wheat. .

The yearly saving on the same scale
would amount to 62,000,000 ths. bread;
or 26,040,000 tbs. flour; or 185,712
flour; or 835,708 bushels of wheat.

What applies to thé saving of wheat
flour, is also, in greater-or less de-
gree, applicable to the saving of beef
and oacon, the two other commodities
that Canada, wust~strive above all
thing# to ship overseas. It is not to
he doubted that habits of economy in-
dneed by watching carefully the con-
sumption of flour, beef and bacon, will
automatically bring about savings in
all other foodstuffs, Thus the sug-
gested saving of 7 cents per head
seems uot only attainnble, but may
lead to even great economics.

The German people are supposed to
be phlegmatic. On the contrary, they
are very emotional,

The Germans are especially fond of
what Is mystical. Young persons of all
climes are given that way, but Ger-
many {fs the home of secret societies
composed not only of young men, but
of those who are older. /

Heinrich Borngesser and Cari Frel-
berg wero regular students at the
University of Heidelberg. Bormgesser
was a merry chap, always rendy for a
joke, while Freiberg was of a serious
cast. Borngesser was a member of a
eorps whose business it was ¢o prac-
tice on one another with the short
sword Freiberg was a member of tho
society for psychical research, whose
object it was to discover some tan-
giblo-dink between the material and
tho spiritual world.

The students of the university fre-
quented a wine and beer house presid-
ed over by a man named Becker. His
daughter Bertha, a girl of seventeen,
wns accustomed to walt on those who
gathered there. She was a Madonna-
like creature, with large, serious eyes,
and there was a reserye about ber that
prevented those she served from the
usual jollying that young men are apt
to give a waltress. The “only person
who cyver tried it was Borngesser, and
he called to her face a look so pained,
so entirely out of keeping with his ban-
ter, that he never tried it again.

Freiberg occasionally went to Beck-
|er's place for bis beer. It was soon
noticed that he was the only man who
frequented the place with whom Bertha
would converse. What tho secret of
this willingness was no one could tell’
All were equally respectful to her, but
ff.after she had set down thelr wine or
beer they’ tried to detain her by a bit
of hat she would invariably bring it
to n halt and Jeave them. In time sho
recelyed a nickname from tho. ‘stu-
dents. It was Lady Purity.

Neither Borngesser nor Freiberg
was of the nobility, but Borngesser
aspired to be an officer in the army.
Both young men served their term in
the military service, but. Borngesser
was doomed to disappointment in se-
curing a commission. The officers were
appointed rom the ruling class.

About the time these two young men
Were leaving the university the pan-
European war broke out. Borngesser’s
attempt to rally Bertha Becker had
affected ber so, much that-it sank
into her heart. It was‘as if he had
broken a fragile vase. There was no
anger in her manner toward him. It
was simply that sbe had been burt.
Strange as it may appear, it irritated
him. He wes ignorant of what this
{rritation meant, but ft was plain to
others that it was the awakening of a
passion for the girl. When be was
hurrying away to the war he found
time to stop at the wine house to sny
goodby to her. He might as well have
said goodby to a stone. ;

But when Freiberg bade ber goodby
{t was very different, , There were few
words spoken between them. Indeed;
Bertha spoke not at all. Carl simply
said goodby,.with a pressure of the
hand, while she said goodby with her
whole soul through ber eyés, and when

Carl Freibem was badly wounded,

He found few person? in the place, and,
as for Bertha, she wa9 working in an

Bot Bertha came homo at night, and
a tow days later Carl went to Heldel-
berg again. Bectha bad returned and,
seeing tho soldier limping up the walk,
ran out to mect him. There had been
no lovemaking between the two, but
now, meeting after all that had hap-
pened, what was in both drew them
together. They flew to each other's
arms.

It was now nutumn, and the summer
was dying by gasps, 03 it usually does.
There would come a cool snap—a win-
ter skirmish line—followed by a re
turn of warm weather, then another
colder period, which would after a few
days give ground before another warm
invasion. Carl and Bertha, when the
evening was not too cold; would sit
out on a bench in the Beckers’ private
garden, as lovers bave sat on garden
benches from time immemorial, locked
in each other’s, arms.

The time was approaching when Cart
would have to go back to the front
His first departure bad not troubled
him, for be had not then been aware
of his love for Bertha; but now a re-
turn to that which was almost certain
death or maiming was awful. Ho was
not thinking of his own sacrifice, but
of Bertha’s. Whenever he spoke to her,
of re-entering those dreadful scenes
she would cling to him as if he were
about to be dragged away to execu-
tion.

Ono night they were sitting in the
garden together when they received a
shock. The darkness was relieved by
a moon nearly full shining out of a
clear sky. The lovers were sitting ina
bower open only to the front. Sudden-
ly a figure appeared at this opening.

“Heavens!” exclaimed Bertha. “It ts
Heinrich Borngesser!*~ 3

There was just enough light of the
moon shining full upon the figure to
show the features. Tho face was
dendly pale, there was a horrible red
gash in the cheek and a bandage across
one eye.

Carl was visibly affected. Was this
really the man who had promised if it
were possible to prove to him that the
dead may communicate witt’ tho living
and had now come back to keep his

agreement? One would suppose that a |;

mind leaning toward a belief in ghosts
would accept the figure as the spiritual
body. of his .returngd. comrade. But
now that a test was put on his credu-
lity Cari doubted,
~ The ghost stood for a moment facing”
the couple, then resumed’ its pace
across the opening. As it passed out
of sight something fluttered from it to
the ground. Carl ran to it and picked
it up. Holding it in the moonlight, he
read with difficulty:

“T forbid the banns.". +

Bertha was hear a state of collapse.
Cari turned to her_and, taking ber in
his arms, endeavored to reassure her.

“What is on the paper?” she asked
faintly, ‘=

“Nothing of moment,” replied Carl

But she insisted, and he was obliged

to tell her. She sank back on the,

bench and covered her face with her
hands. 4 3

“Wo must part.” sho moaned.

“Not by this command.” ’

“He has come back ‘fromthe otber
world to warn us. It is not God's will
that we should live for each other,”

“Sweetheart,” eaid Carl, “there is
something wrong bere. If he’had real-
ly come back from the dead I would
have felt the presence of a spirit. On
tho contrary, I felt the spirit of a liv-
ing man."” ys =

“How do you explain his coming?

Three generations have been wearing the clothing that we sold them. Our clothes were good enough for the old Grandfather; as the

years sped by they improved so much that the Son found.them equal to his requirements; to-day the Grandson finds that they have kept pace
with Progress, and he, too, is satisfled. The old Grandfather's taste wasn’t very fastidious, perhaps, but the Grandson isn’t so easily pleased,

and the fact that our clothing pleases him shows how much it has improved.

did calk his wife up, and they figured ‘out so much for potatoes and so much
for their vegetables, in all about one hundred and fifty dollars. . And T anid,
“Why don't you raise-your‘own vegetables?” ““Me?" he gasped, *"Ye rou.”
*“T can't,” he said “You say you were raised on a farm?” “Yes
why don't you-rdise your own vegetables?” “Maze he asked again. “You've
saldi‘Mo’ three times now. You¢come in to advise me about increasing pro-
duction. ~How much Jond liaye you?» “A little backyard.” “How s big?”
“About fifty square feet< “Well, that would grow a lot of vegetables.”
“Would it?” he sald. Yes, and if.every backyard dn tHe.city of Torontw was
cultivated even ten feet square, enough’ vegetables would“be grown. to supply
all the fimilles. There are About five hundred thousand people living in To-
ronto, and nearly every one of them fas a backyard. They have to liave a
way out so to speak.. Ifyou only had a plot forty or fi feet square you
could grow all your vegetables, Youycould grow your peas and beans by tho
door, and your celery and carfots, ‘and beets and lettuce; and your tomatoes
against the’fence.” “Well; how would that’ help the empire?’ he asked.
“Well,” 1 said,!“if you can produce these stuffs for your own use that would
let the other fellow spend his time on growing the big products, the fleld
cropé&. “And,” I.said, {we are, going’ to talk and write this up in tho news,
papers and gay, ‘A girden for every familyin 1917.’ Evecery person in the
Province of Ontario could produce at least*twenty-five dollars worth of stuif,
and that multiplied bythe numbér of people in‘the provinte would make mil;
ifons of dollars saved for the Government.”

Now | would like to see.some things done atvan early dato, things =that
the farmers can do for themselyes, largely.’ I would lke to seo a mile of
good roads ench year in évery township. (Applauge.) I believe that we need
instructionefor our farmers'.sons and daughters along lines of aciontific farm
ing. (Applause,). Now, we can't teach any person, but one wh" lins some
knowledge of farming, the farmers’ sons are the ones we'want. So the boy
who comes to u8 with a good common farm education, with the beat know-
ledge thatshis father had and comes to us And finds out about the best breeds
of sheep dnd has a breed of sheep at home to compare with them, anid the
anme with cows, can get something Out of the College. He go3s homo with
the idea that now, with his father’s experience and the help of the Agricul-
tural Representative that the Governmentshas here for his assistanes, he can
use his own brains to. better his*farm. That is fll the Agricuiturnl College
ean do for him,’*make him thfhk. And with a mile more of good roads in
every township each year conditions would’soon be. better, - It fs oll very wall
for us old fellows to talk about progress, but we cannot do {t all. Our best
days are over, Here are those eight boys before me, como to the meeting

his opportunities, Now,-I would like to say that the boy going fo, schoo)

‘Well,

with the idea that he is going to get something out of It evary duy, that he
wis going to know something more about farming every day, will succeed,

I think that the teaching in our country schools should lead to proper liv
ing in the country, Of course some will blip away to the elties, but I vhink it
would be more useful to the boy to be trained towards farm life than what
is being done towards fitting him for matriculation, Fit him for the thing
at hand,

I suy wo might do that. It is all very well to give him bopk iInstruotion,
but every farmer's boy of to-day should be a good judge of corn before he
is fourteen years of age. Such a course could be put in place of many of the
subjects that he {s forced to learn, sitting in the seat with his feet hardly
touching the floor, and learning something that he will never use. But you
say the Education Department should attend to that. 1 have talked with
many educational experts from Dr, Pyne down, and they all say that they
are willing ‘to take the matter up a8 soon as the peopic show a desire to
liave something done along that line.

You can make the schools what you want them to be. Jf you want hetton
schools you can have them. 1 would like to see that evory school teacher
who goes to your schools has had a course in the Agricultural College. Our
College is open’ all the year round, and we had over two hundred teachers
there during the summer holidays last year. We don’t wint them to wiink
that they have to teach farming, but we want them to know about the corn
and the grains that are raised and consumed, There is no reason why every
teacher shouldn't have that training:

And there js no reason why every school shouldn't have it Hcliool gar-

to see the children, before thy study about the Kamschatka, Dwine and Neva

And: our boys and our men are woefully ignorant of these things, and If they

Then I’ want you to prepare for the electric power. The farmer of to-
doy is a business man. He ibydependent on nobody now, can remember
wien 1 used to come to town with my father, and how he would grasp me
by the hand and take me into the bank with him.~Father always went in a
kink of apologetically, and I slunk along behind him, for1 wanted to’ see the
animals in the ciige. Thé banker came out and gruffly ‘asked when we want-
ed. My father sald he wanted to deposit some money.. Father said it very
Hpologetically, as if he were asking ao favor. The bafiker’s manner ‘was
pompous and lifty, I do not know what that banker would have looked lke ff
father had wanted to borrow money instead”’of deposit it.--He sald, “Can you
make out the deposit slip or do-you wabt*someone to fix {t for you?” Now
that wa’ an insinuction of ignoratice {ni my father. My father was a well
read man. But-there was.such a distance between the men. Now, that. wont
go any more inthese days with eggs at five cents apiece, corn at $1, wheat
nearly $2 and hogs at 934 cents live weight.. You do not need tortake your hat
off.to anyone anymore. And thosé prices will never go.back to the old’ prices
we used to get, but you will have to-be sure that you have got the goods to
sell. ost ta SAGSRR

Eges bring in sixty cents a dozen now.’ We have Rock eggs in Guelph
Yor breeding that we sell for ten cents aplece, I Had an egg in Kingsville
yesterday that I was told cost five cents, .At’any rate hers should be profit-
able, “You say that that’s the old woman's job; that. she looks after the
chickens;-and what she gets from them in her money. And’ at that they have
to roost on the old cutter. .(Laughter.) That's playing the gime. I want
thé farmers to do a lot of thinking. Maybe thinking gf.corn Will lead them
jnto,chickens, and maybe chickens will lead them into sleep, That willyal
profit you something, The hen that laya.eggs for.fifteen days in succession
and then quits and goes and sets.on them, at the very time that eggs are
high, isn’t going to do you’ any godd. You must have hens laying when prices
are high. Yon have have to hatch-them early jn tho season and keép them
down.in the cellar and leave one of>tlie childrén to*watch them, but even If
you pay him you will be gaining in the end, for you have interestéd him in
chickens; Why, if he leave you at twenty years you will have lost him, the
best help that you could get. Get him Interested in the farm, and Jet hin
take his share of its responsibility, ‘

They tell: me you.can dig a hole any place in Ontario and strike water
And they tell"me that if you just let-down ao pipe you can tap it in theyhouse
With a few attachments the girls’can get both hot and cold water fromthe tap
jn your own farmhouse, and the mothor, toopwho is geting older, now, doesn't
need to igo out. and bring»in snow to. get water to heat for the baths. That
is a seemingly common thing, water, but the good God gave it to us and when
are we fellows going to understand that running water is a necessity, We
should hive waterAn oun farm houses. I do not know, but I think’ it would
be worth while to find®out what it would cost to put in a bathroom, and wind-
mill and fank, and I don't‘ know but what ft would.be a good {dea to send,
out notices to,th@ farmers saying; yau can*fave jot Water and a bathroom in
your house for so much. I think it would be money well spent at any rate,
for I don’t think our girls would be going to work fp towns for $3.50 a week
if they could have everything handy and hot water fh the tap.

Now, Co-operation.» We have established a department, with Mr. Hart
{n charge. In the speech from the throne, which yoll may have noticed In the
papers, there was menfion made with regard to the Agricultural Assocta-
tlon whereby farmers coud have co-operation, where they may get their
hefids togethér/and do-those things that they can do In their communities
which theyscannot do without the :ommunity spirit, and break up the petty
jealousies that are so prevelent. *There was a co-operative corporation in
connection with the fruit growers in Ningara. The agents offered to sell the
apples for the growers: at 26c. a burrel. And, while they, secured a better
market for thé apples, and the farmers got $1.25 more for their apples per
barrel than they.could hive gotten themselves, they begrudged the com-
mission. They dl@;not*understand the value of cooperation

Of course there “are some co-operative combinations which we call trusts
which are not beneficial to the producers, but I think we have not many in
this country. ;

Thon let us get rid of. these petty jealousies and let us all get together,
If we ever get together in the Province of Ontario from Essex to Glengarry, and
get together for the Improvement of the churches, for the improvement of our
achools, for.the-+mprovement of the. mon, women and children, the church,
the school, and the people as 1 community centré will rise up in their might
and enjoy prosperity, If we live through to that time we will live to enjoy

the clear blue sky and the good ground, and reap the Joys of prosperity.
When that time comes I hiope still to be Commissioner of Agriculture.
