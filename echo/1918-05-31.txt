, ONTARIO,

 

A Great Success-:-Thousands
sts Enjoy. It. :

—_—_—_—

One of the most enjoyable. and
unique birthday partiés even given in
Essex county was that of the Brunner,
Mond Canada: Limited, the officials
of whom on Friday last (Victoria Day)
were “at home” to ll Amheratburg
and many friends ’from surrounding
districts, on the first anniversary of
pouring cement for the immense soda
ash plant they ore building on the
river front at Gordon, The weather
like the reign of the beneficent queen,
in-whose perpetual honor the day is
observed as a holiday; was perfect’ up
to 6 that night when rain shortened
the time for sightseeing, but in no
way dampened the ardor and delight
of the merrymaking: | that went on
within the big machine slop, in which
the prin¢{pal items om the afternoon's
program ‘were carried but.

The invitation of the-B. M. C. offic-
fals was certainly received. with spon-
taneous - pleasure, and! no family plan
was perfect that day that did not in-
clude a visit to the plant. The run-
ning of a street car every fifteen min-
utes of the afternoon until well on in
the evening, from Amherstburg to the
bridge, was a great convenience, and
yet was not sufficient, accommodation
for the crowds, many+ofwhom went
afoot or by machine: It Was a rollick-
ing, Jolly crowd of happy people, who
fully appreciated and freely compli-
mented nagement on the gen=
erous p 8 that were so wel) orgin-
ized for thelr entertainment. It's easy
to. be ‘happy, when’ optinilstic, and
with an Industrial concern of the ex-
tent of the B. M. sending the very
life blood of enterprise pulsing through
the business and home life of Amberst-
burg, the keynote of everyday life is
optimism,

Notwithstanding the fact that the
.program started promptly on time,
over three hundred persons had gath-
ered on the floor of the boilér_build-
ing when beautiful Union Jacks were
flung to the breéze | simultaneously
from the roofs of the main. ten-storey
building and the crusHer plant. Every
head was bared as the orchestra play-
ed- “God Save the King” and “The
Star Spangled Banner", while whistles
tooted, men.cheered and a fusilade of
dynamite bombs Were set off on ‘the
roof nearly two hundred feet up. This
kind of “firecracker” was an entirely
new method of saluting in Amherst-
burg and. Was most effective, {fa bit
nerve-wracking for the timid omnes

Assistant Manager Campbell and
James Meehan. had the honor of holgt-

ae,

  

  

  

 

>| ing the-flags.

Manager Rutherford presided, both
at this ceremony and afterwards in
of the machiné shop. He introduced
Capt. (Rey,)— Arthur Carlisle, of
|. Windsor, late chaplain of the 99th
Battalion, who delivered a magnificent
patriotic oration. Mr. Carlisle, who
spent a year at the front, opened by
wishing tie company many lappy re-
turns. of the day, for this.plant which
means. s0 “Mmueh-for. ike development
mot only of this district, but also” of
the whole Dominion. His tribute to
Queen Victoria, in whose honor the
day is célebrated, brought tears’ to
many eves, “There was nothing more
magnificent in her reign,” declared
theyspeaker, “than making the Empire
aon Jmperial unity.” .The Union Jack
in her reign became fhe symbol of
laiberty, right, advancement, enlighten-
ment and civilization. These days are
[days of heart searching to sea if each
one of us is dojng his part. In a fer-
vid clone the.gpeakermaid: “God grant

that this flag unfurled to-day may be |

to each Of us a remindervof our/duty,
to ourselves, devoted to the cause of
our: fellowmen, faithful and true to,
God, by whose Ryace, mercy and help,
we hope to-come. successfully through,
ithe great struggle.”

The gatheniig then ‘adjourned }
the machine shop, which wns taste-
fully decorated with national enafgns,
bunting,.etc,, the: southeast corner
having been converted Into an attrac-

 
    
    
  
 

‘| tive booth. for the Daughters of tha

Empire, who displayed samples of
sewing and knitting, and received
/many orders for socks to be sent ta
our boys overseas. 4

Mr. Rutherford warmly .welcomed
his. guests and spoke briefly.on fle un-
falling loyalty of his assistants through
whose indefatigable efforts the work
had been pushed through to its pres-
ent stage, emphasizing particularly the
invaluable~-assistance rendered by
Messrs, Campbell, Delisle and Tyler,
of the construction force, and Messrs.
Haas and Stancliffe, in the office.
The product which the plant*wi)l pro-
duce is necded very extensively by the
Allies in the making of munitions, or
as he expressed it, to put the “die”
in “dynamite”, and to forward its con-
struction was helping the cause not
only of noble Britain but also every
noble ally standing shoulder to shoul-
der with them helping -maintain hu-
manity’ and christiinity throughout

Monday showed . themselves keenly
alive to the question of a pure water
supply, supporting the proposition to|
go into partnership-with the Brunner,
Mond, Monday, in the waterworks
proposition, the terms and details of
which have been published in The
Echo for the past four weeks, he
keen interest taken in the question is
shown by recording the largest vote
ever taken on any by-law In the pis-
tory of the-town. Those favorable to
the proposition were splendidly organ-
ized and their. vote getting machine
worked to perfection, while opponents
of the agreement we also busy, all|

tie Brunner, Mond, that has done so

much for Amherstburg, everyone |
recognizes that tie great prosperity
with which the” town 1s blessed “nt

present is due directly to the €stab-
lishment of this big industrial-enter-
prise here, and the very Kindly re-|

pany and the town in tlie way of local
trade, most of which 18+ carried on

no reason for any delay in hurrying
their work<to the production point,
certainly means much for the old
town. Nothing short of national dis-
angen can now interfere with the de-

Windsor politicians, received a se-

vere jolt on Thursday when it wan Bs

announced fromsToronto that Alfred ee) =

Mlerg, Police Magistrate of Watker-

ville, had been appointed to the -va-

cancy in Windsor caused by the death

of Police Magistrate Leggatt. Even

papers, usually sympathetic with Pro-

vincial Government action and apolo-

getic for even rank mistakes, angrily

characterize the moves made by Con-

servative’ politicians in connection

with “this appointment as “Political

camouflage.” Theré is no doubt that

Barrister W. A. Smith, of Kingayille,

was. a logical successor to the late

P. M. Leggatt, and would have made

an ideal ‘incumbent, but: in their ef-

forts to spoil his  ehances Windsor

politicians even stuffed the Detroit

Press into believing that Mr. Smith

had declined-the position owing to the

salary being insufficient, putting him

in ® very Indelicate position, when

that phase of the question had never f

been, mentioned, During war time,

wiien political jobery was supposed to

be “canned”, the various moves made

by Tory ward ‘*heelers in’ Windsor

showed very plainly that thefr pro-

testations of loyalty anl everything to y :

win the war were “camouflage” of the

rottenest kind. Just how any party

had a cinch on the position at this.

Hime offpolitical truce (7) is difficult to bs

understand. Howevwer,*a quarrel be-

tween the big chiefs let common peo-

ple into secrets they suspected but

couldn't prove before, and, that all fa

not_harmony in Windsor Conservative

counsels, Mr, Miers no doubt will ;

fill the Position with much acceptance. 3

but afteFall why should politics “hava

80 much to.do with the appointment >.

Udder—Late Spring Suggestions
For the Farmer.

(Contributed by Ontario Department of
Agricaiture, Toronto.)

HE arrival of spring brings
up the question, “When and
bow shail I set my bees out
of the Cellar?” to the minds

of all farmer beekeepers, The an-
swer calls for judgment on the part
of each beekeeper, The factors which
must take a part in forming correct
judgment are (1) the cellar, (2) the
bees, and (3) the season.

The ideal cellar will permit the
beekeeper to keep his bees confined
much longer than will an unfavorable
cellar, This is desirable. A fairly
dry, dark, easily regulated and venti-
lated cellar when mheé temperature
can be maintained at 45 degrees
Fabr. is ideal. Very few Ontario;
farm céllars will meet thesé require-
ments, however, so that the weather
conditions play a more prominéat
part in the farmer-beckeeper’s deci-
sion. ‘ 9

They Proved Their Great Value After

of the grent world war, + _ ‘

“For years the French general sta

“Frenchmen gill believed that the main
onslaught’ would come across the
French frontier and had made their
plans for their greatest resistanco in
this region. France eitered the war’
with only about 100 army airplanes,
but Germany, which had foreseen the
part this new {nstrumeit was to play,
had a much larger equipment.

“Yet a few days after the Belginn

near the Belgian-German frontier saw
a sight that immediately caused a
change in the French operations. The
Germans were crossing the frontier in
enormous numbers, and the fact be-
came apparent that in this section the
main attack wne to come. This news,
flashed to General Joffre,-caused tbat
sudden alteration in his plans that
made possible the successful Wattles of

HOW TO KEEP WELL}

BY JOHN W. S: McCULLOUGH, SLD. DP. CHIEF OFFICER
OF THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF HEALTH.

YPHOID FEVER Is a severe disease coming on with headache, rise
of temperature, diarrboea, and abdominal distention. It always
occurs an the result of taking into one’s stomach food or drink

7 contaminatec with the body discharges. These discharges may
! enter one’s mouth in water which has been polluted with sewage
containing typhoid germs, with milk or food to which the germs have been
learried by flies, by dirty hands, by dirty water, etc., or by direct contact
‘with a person ill of typhoid fever. It is also distributed by “carriers,” that
is by persons who, though immune ‘to the disease themselves, carry the

agorms of the disease in their intestines and transmit it to others through
the discharges reaching food, etc. ‘Typhoid Mary,”
the New York cook who gave the disease to a large
number of people before she was locked up, is a
Atyphoid examp!e of a typhoid carrier. People who have typhoid fever may
|estey the disease for a long time and be a source of danger to others,
lespectally if they heve anything to do with the preparation of food.
. Typhoid fever is rather common about the farms especially if a single
vease tas occurred in a neighborhood where there is any chance of the
genera! water supply. such as a spring, stream, or lake, receiving the intes-
(tinal disebarges of the sick person. A typical example of this octurred
jm connection with an outbreak of the disease at Plymouth, Pa, in 1885.
Ptymouth is a mining town with a population at the time of the outbreak
jof about 8,000. Its water-supply was obtained from a mountain stream
draining an almost uninhabited watershed, and the water for the town was
impourded in a series of four impounding reservoirs. In January a man
jliving up stream, who had spent his Christmas holidays-in Philadetphia,
‘became {l] at his home. The excréta were not disinfected but-were thrown
either into the frozen creek or upon its snow-covered banks.” In March
there came a spring thaw and the accumulations of exereta were- washed
""down -the stream. Three weeks later there was an acute outbreak of
typhoid: fever in the little town. In some days as many as 100 cases
occurred. One thousand and four cases were reported. There were, it is
estimated, altogether 1,500 cases and the deaths numbered 114. The
infection was most marked in those who used the town water supply, the
epidemic being limited to the users of this water, Those who used well,
water escapéd the disease. This epidemic of typhoid was studied and
definitely traced to its source by competent observers, and is a marked
example of the necessity of protection of public water supplies.

We are not exempt from such lessons in Ontario. The outbreak of
typhoid in Ottawa in 1911 and again in 1912, and that of the town of
Sarnia in 1911-12, all of which were proven to have occurred as the result
of sewage-polluated water; have been sharp lessons in our own province,
lessons unhappily which¢have not yet convinced the respective civic
authorities of the necessity of adequate protection of their. water-supplics:

Probably the most extraordinary

discovery of a comet was that of the

One known as “a 1896." It happened

this way, as told in Science by W. W. |,

Campbell of the Lick observatory:
Professor Charlés D. Perrine discov-
ered a comet on Nov. 17, 1895, and
observed it night after night till Dec.
20, 1895, when it was lost to sight in
the glare of the sun's rays. Professor
Perrine and Mr. Campbell calculated
ita orbit for 1996, and their computa-
tions were published in the astronom-
fcal journals. 3

Just before dawn on Jan. 30, 1898,
Perrine and Campbell watched it
emerge from behind the sun at the
Precise spot they had predicted. On
Feb. 14 a cablegtam in cipber an-
nounced that Lamp at Kiel, Germany, |
had rediscovered Perrine’s comet that

differed by twenty-four minutes of time
from the position in whith Perrine
knew his comet to-be. This was not
explained for several weeks, when it
turned out that in translating thé @-
pher cablegram a mistake had been
muade and that the cablegram as sent
Diaced the comet just where Perrine
had observed it.

Red Heads of Asiatic Turkey
Last of the Baal Worshivers,

—_——-

HAVE SOME QUEER CUSTOMs,

 

All Males Wear Red Caps and Around
Their Throats Red Knotted Cords ang
Allow Their Wives to Beat Them—Ai)
Babies Are Salted When Born.

‘Strange people are the Red Heads of
Asiatic Turkey. They gre the last of
the ‘Baal worshipers. The men Wear
red caps; hence their name Red Heads,
They also wear red knotted cords
around thelr necks. The cord is put
on during babyhood and is never re.
moved. It is interred with the body,
after death, They shave their heady
except for a patch on the top, and
here they allow the hair to grow long
and plait it into pigtails, which bang
about their ears. They are tall, wiry
fellows, with enornious appetites for
both food and drink.

The women. who do not vell them-
selves and who dress simply in loose
fitting garments, are thin and spare,
but wonderfully strong. In their
homes they wear breeches as well iis
skirts. There is no wife beating among
the Red Heads, bag plenty of husband
beating. The husbands take their fre-

| quent chastisements meekly and pa-

tently. They employ themselves, both
the women and the men, in agriculture
and theft. They produce a couple of
crops, tobacco aud durra. The rest or
their time is given up to looting tho
Turks' crops and cuttle. z

In the center of every village there
is a small circle railed off, and in this
space there js planted the special reli-
gious emliem, on evergreen oak’ No

ove except the father priest of the vil- ,

lage enters the Inclosed ground, which
is decorated with small flags, strings
of coins and bright colored beads.
Around and about the circle the Red
Héads celebrate the only religious fes-
tival known to them, “the gathering of
the new moon,” wililch takes place ev- ,
ery month. Directly a new moon makes

its appearance fhe people are, called

together by a Jay priest beating a bar-

Fires are lit, the cooking utensils
placed thereon and the sheep killed by

the animals’ blood on the oak, and the
carcasses flayed and cut up into joints
and the latter cocked over the fires,

As they decflled to go‘no frutier,
they, returned to the forks.of the Lick-

Here the Indians, retaining their pris-
onerg, sepjrated from the rest of the
companyvand proceeded up the Miami

another the female prisoners.

With the women api childrén was

buried her child, after which she was
compelled to continues on with the
other prisoners. At last, after a long
and tedious journey, they arrived at
Detroit, ~

The male prisoners, jaden ‘with the
Dlunder.of their own homes, . were
marched across the country, stffering
all sorts of indignities from the In-
Hjans. Kratz had a huge copper ket-

Gen. Macomb, who paid their price in
biankets. The sufferings endured by
con on their march had rendered
them unfit for work, so. they were
cared for by the authorities until they
Were able to look after themselves.
Leonard Kratz, not knowing where
his wife was, hoped that ther captors
would bring her to Detroit, Every
day he would, go.to thesdock, wher2
the canoes-arrived from the different
parts of the country, expecting that
some day’he would find her. At lage
he was rewarded, for as he was about
to. turn to a boat, which had just ar-
rived, he heard a voice cailing, “Leon:
ard, don't you"know me?” It was his
wife. The hardships of the Journey

had so altered her appearance that lie
did not recognize her.

In 1781 Kratz, the Mungers and
Tofflemires, who were also taken
prisoners at Ruddell’s, were settled on
Hog island, where they remained un-
til 1786, when Kratz. moved to Tren-

the Mungers moved to Grosse isla,
