Those who knew him best said that
Sir Wilfrid was in a very real sense
passionately fond of children. He re-
laxed to them, he loved them, and
they loved him: Many are the stories
told of his interest in them, Chil-
dren seemed to get closer to ‘‘the
Chief” than anyone,else, There were
times, in the ‘stress of big ovents,
when matters of policy were to be

counsel from him then without suc-
cess. No premature intimations were
forthcoming. He became to all asso-
ciated with him a seeker—not a giver
—of information. One left his pres-
ence, having gone for guidance, with
the conviction that he wd laid baré

|his whole mind-and thought at the

delicate prompting of the Chief's

|skillful interrogations, but realizing

that the latter had communicated
nothing,

For the little folk he always had
an open door and an instant relaxa-

   

phers had for wecks been struggling
with crowds and erecting pedestals to |
obtain. }
The devotion of the habitant of
rural Quebec to Sir Wilfrid Laurier
was well illustrated by an incident
duting the tampaign of 1911. The
Liberal léader was leaving Bona-
venture station, in Montreal, very,
early one morning to proceed, via
Coteau, to accept the nomination for |
Soulanges, At the station he passed

 

 
 

“Sir Wilfrid Laurier,” replied one
of the group of newspapermen near-
by.

The woman’s face was a picture.
“Bn verite?’s(Is that true?) she per-
sisted, turning from’ one to another
for confirmation.

When she wis convinced she ran
after the departing figure and
stroked the sleeve of his coat as if
it were something. holy. Sir Wilfrid
turned and shook her hand, ere the
poor woman fied in confusion,

while he was speaking at Edmonton,
So great was the’crowd that had as-
sémbled in Alberta’s capital thai hot

FERTILIZERS HELP TO
MAKE BIG CORN CROPS

 

In response to many inquiries from
Ohio farmers regarding proper meth-
ods of fertilizing the corn crop — for
1919, the Ohio Experiment Station
urges. the use of from 200 to 300
pounds of acid phosphate or steamed
bonemeal per acre. The Station also
advises that farmers apply from 8 to
10 tons of manure to the acre before
the land is plowed, whenever possible,
as the combination of acid phosphate
or steamed bonema@al and manure has
given the most profitable increases in
the corn crop, Testd show an increase
of 34 bushels of corn per acre when
fertilized}with 10 tons-of manure and
$20 pounds of acid phosphate per acre,
as compared with land*wihiich received
no fertilizer or manure treatment.
