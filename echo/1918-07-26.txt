the attempt to burn the: residenco of
the sisters are all now in the hands
of the authorities, “having been “dl

Edson Worth was dreaming of Marie
Duntley, when he should have been
Wide awake. Marie was the night op
erator at Wolf Springs, forty miles
west, yet ho felt as near to her as
though she was the width of a’ parti-
tion beyond him. Edson had been at
Merrivale in charge.of the station for
two years, He used to boast—and
Prove-that he could Identify the
sender of half a dozen ticks over the
wire, through familiarity with the
touch.” Poe fh :

“It isn't the ticks, they are all the
game, plain as the alphabet,” Edson
used.to say. “Bat every operator has
a@ touch essentially his own. It’s like
@ mannerism in speech. It takes an
expert to detect it. I call myself one.
So, I always know who ts talking.”

Edson had been “talking” up.to an
hour previous, little snatches of greet-
ing, snappy raillery, to greet re
sponsive brief words that made Edson
sure he was not Indifferent to the
bright, datoty little operator at Wolf
Springs.

“Why, when Marie is on the wire, the
first. tick of the call sends a_ thrill
through me. It’s just as If our fingers
met,” Edson had told his sister once.
“That must mean true love, hey, Mag-
gle?” and Maggie had encouraged his
conception with a smiling nod, and Ed-
son Was content.

He was all ulone, and it was nearly
midnight. He had slipped down in his
chalr into a comfort seeking position,
for routine stuff was out of the way,
and there was nothing due on train
detail under on hour, unless special
orders came out. Usually Edson read
or smoked’ to keep awake. His
thoughts of fair Marie, however. lulled
him into a hazy, pleasant thrall, and
insensibly he glided into somnolency.

Edson was guilty of a fatal lack of”
diligence. If No. 27 on the North
Branch was reported on time, he was
to telegraph: the bridge station at
Woodville to hold 34 on the main. un-
til the branch train had cleared the
bridge. Orders were due within the
hour. For the hour and beyond tt Ed-
son slumbered. He awoke with a
start. Such a thing bad never hap:
pened before. His first glance was at
the clock. He sprang. to his feet, a
White horror in \his face, his body in
a cold perspiration, Train 34 had
passed eighty minutes agone, and he
had not heard {t, and—

“—met on the bridge. Both trains
were late and must-have, disregarded
éignals. Casualties! heavy and two
couches In the river, ¢ompletely sub-
merged.”

A hand of ice seemed to seize his
heart in no crushing grip, his brain
reeled. Before his mental vision there
pdssed a frightful picture of carnage
and destruction. For the moment and
for hours“Jater Edson Worth was an
insane, irresponsible’ creature of fran-
tie unreason and impulse.

His first action was to close his ears
to the monotonous drone of what he
reconized as a fragment of a press dis-
patch. He dashed from the station
like a being pursued by dreadful phan-
toms. That noon he had recelved his
monthly salary and it was still intact
In his pocket. He passed the cottage
In which his sister lived, but only in-
creased his reckless rate of speed. Its
Welcoming lights had no influence to
lire him to shelter, to compassion, to
Safety! A

Edson tore along the dark country
Pond until, brenthless, exhausted, he
Sink to the platform of a rullroad
Gepot on a ine golog north. _A train
Came along within the hour. Edson en-
{ered its dimly lighted smoking car
ond crouched in the corner of Its dark-
est seat. .

“Where to?” challenged the: conduc-

tor. :
“Terminus” sounded hoarsely in the
arched throat of the new passenger.
Me paid th fare, knowing from the
pretentions @mount nnmed that it was
over two hundred miles ahead. One
urging [mpulge directed him—to get as
fast and 28 farfrom home and’friends
and all the World.as speedily as pos-
sible.

The wildefness, the fartherest out-
posts of clyiijzation seemed to beckon
him on—h6, gh Ishmael, accursed of
all monkijg as a morderer! His
crime crushed him. He would bury
himself amid an obscurity barren of
men and homes, He might not be able
rto forget, liut he would meet with no

sor

| Edson, as Mark Lane, was quartered

tm ‘a rudely constructed hut with a
mate, a Uvely' genial young fellow
‘about his own age. They meased at .
ne of the big eating sheds, but slept
tn the ten-by-twelve shack with a nar-
row fireplace and some skins for bed
covering. Ned Walters strove hard to
break through the reserve of his mate.
And at last he eucceeded. Gradually
Edson became so that ho. longed for
and cherished the companionship. Ned
Walters told of a wifo and little child,
whom he had been to leave to
yeek work. where he could find it. He
had Ianded up against the hard eeryi-
tude of the logging’ camp. Once a
month he sent to the nearest post of-.
fice with the camp messenger his en-
tire salary, to be forwarded to tho
loved ones at home. One day he eat
reading and rereading a letter he had
received from his wife. It eeemed to
oppress him greatly.’

“Bad news,” insinuated Edson tn
sympathetic inquiry.

“Pretty bad,” “responded Walters.
“You see, our féw sticks of furniture
were mortgaged, and they are bringing
the. pressure of collection to.bear. I
can’t send enough to run the house and
release the debt.”’ |

“Will that help?” asked Edson, hand-
ing over his pay envelope.

“Yes, but—”" ~

“Money is no use to me. I bave no
home, no friends to send it to,” mur-
mured Edson in a broken volce. “You
are welcome to It, mate.”

“It will be repaid, belleye me that!”
cried Walters, overcome with relief
and joy.

One month later Edson Worth was
taken down with a two-wecks' spell of
Yéver. Walters nursed him constantly.
When Edson recovered, Walters in-
formed him that a relative of his wife
had come to the rescue of the family
and bad decured an opening for work
for him back in his home city. /

“You will receive back that money
you so generously loaned me just as
soon as I get my bearings,” promised
Walters.

It was pretty lonesome for Edson
nfter this chance friend left him.
Then one day he made a discovery that
unsettled bilm greatly. On a-strip of
paper lying under the bed he observed
penciled notations, his own name, that
of the atation he had deserted and the
name of Marie Duntley. 5

Edson tried to figure out the mean-
fng of this. The handwriting was that
of Walters. Suddenly his mind was
illumined. In his fevered delirium he
had bared all the story of the pass,
and Walters had it in mind to investi-
gate it when he returned to civiliza-
tion._ No matter what kindly motive
might impel him, there was danger of

The bigger Comfort Soap bar gives you more soap for the money

you know, there are no premiums with the Bigger Bar’s wrapper.
Here is 4 real éhance to save in housekeeping expenses.

COMFORT SOAP

If you really want more GOOD soap for

your money you'll just firmly ask your

grocer for the bigger Comfort Bar—he can

supply you. If you are still getting the

former, smaller Comfort Soap, keep

on saving the wrappers, they are still
for premiums.
