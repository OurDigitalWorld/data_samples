EVERYBODY GROW EATABLES

The Essentials In Planning Garden—
Best Varieties to Plant.

(Coutributed by Ontario Department of

Agriculture, Toronto.)

T NO TIME in many years has
the necessity and importance
of the home vegetable garden
been so clearly shown as for

this coming summer. France, our
wonderful ally, has since the French
Revolution been a nation of small
farmers, her people of small means.
cultivating somo aynilable land to
produce a portion of thelr own house-
hold foodstuffs and to increase the
wealth of the nation. Great Britain,
threatened with a shortage of food-
stuffs, determined to cultivate all
available land possible to offset this
shortage and we, in Canada, bending
every energy toward facilitating

these great nations chould do all in}

 

 

growers who arf seriously handicap-

production of
Every ,city, town and village dweller
has an opoprtunity to help-in this
great work, in that there aro® hun-
dreds of available plots,now practi-
eally unproductive, shfth could be

the wealth of the country,
Vegetables an Important Food.

__ Vegetables should form an import-
ant portion of the dally food of the
average hiiman. being, for they pos=

essential in the proper digestion of
the ‘heavy foods,;such as meats,

AIT backyards cannot be prepared |
in one year to grow vegetables of an
excellent quality. Some portion of the
yard, however, may be devoted to
this purpose, or;elf it is convenient, |
there are usually many vacant lots
which are not too far from one's place
of abode which possibly could-be-de
voted {o the growing of vegetables.

Some Essentials,

 

 

First of all it is eseential that the
vegetable garden, nO matter how
small, be planted ‘according to some
plan or rule. No one attempts to

build a house or to set ont a peren-
Dial flowerjborder without using some
drawing or ‘ehart to go by. Why
should the veketable garden be treat-.
ed differently? Hapbazard planting
will prove a fallure, and in order to
“overcome this it should be remember-
ed in Jaying out the garden that—
-(1) Tall plants will be most effec-
tive if placed behind low ones) not
intermingled with them.

(2) All plants closely — allied
should be grown together, not in the
same row, but im rows adjoining one
another,
~ (3) Tho fences. may be decorated
with yine crops which may be support-
od on the fences. by means of strings
or Jattice work,

(Ay All quickly maturing vege-
tnbles should be_planted fn a portion
of the garden by themselves so that
they may bo harvested and the ground
used for othef.croys later on,

Secure Sted Now—But Plant Only
When Soil Is Ready.

The backyard gardener should de
cide very early Which crops are to, be
grown and.should purchase his seed
as sopn as possible. 1t must be re-
membered, however, that much of
this seed*mnay be wasted if it is plant-
ed too carly in the season. The sojl |
must be wamm to receive the seeds,
and amateur gardeners’ must have
patience antil) it is certain that good
growing weatlber has come. It is pos-
sible .in ordimary seasons to plant
some -vegeiabiles in April, and *yet
many backyard veretable enthuslagts
will be well advised-to wait until the
middie of “May before doing very
much in the garden.
