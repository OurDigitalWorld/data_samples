If & woman is nervous or has dizzy
spells, suffers from awful pains at regular
or irregular intervals she should turn to a
tonic made up of herbs, and without al-
cobol, which makes weak women strong
and sick women well. It is Dr. Pierce’s
Favorite Prescription. Druggists sell it in
liquid or tablets, Send 10 cents to the
Invalids’ Hotel, Buffalo, N. Y., for trial
package. Then, for the liver and bowels
nothing is so good as Dr. Pierce’s Pleasané

Pellets. These arc little, a
pills, composed of Mayapple, leaves of
aloe, root of jalap—things that Nature
grows in the ground.

The procreative impulse rules China
as the Manchus never ruled it. Three
out of four babies die, but the fourth
is more than enough. Kill 100,000,000
Chinese and in two generations there
are more graves cluttering the earth,
but as many living as ever,

The principal product of China is
cheap, rice-fed men, who work and
starve, or perhaps freeze to death in
the cold January nights, or die by the
hundreds of thousands {n periodical
famines, or obstinately survive and
raise more cheap, rice-fed men. There
are hundreds of millions of them with
vision bounded by a bow! of rice and
the desire of maile offspring. The race
1s like the sea, inexhaustible, Imperish-
able. It does not wither awaWat the
breath of western civilization. It does
not disappear, It does not go uader.
It persists.

It is, moreover, an tmpermeable
race; to attempt to Interpenetrate it is
as hopeless ag to pour water into a
Jar filled with mercury. I thought of
Macao, Walter E. Weyl writes in
Harper's Magazine. The Portuguese
have been there’ more than three cen-
turies and have contrived to make of
{t a beautiful city, living on opium,
gambling and other devices, lke a
pretty prostitute in pink ribbons. The
picturesque streets have Portuguese
oames, but the city is irredeemably,
analterably Chinese, Look down from
the green-clad hills upon the flat roofs,
blue and green and red, of the clus-
tered, wind-swept city, and you see
the homes not of Portuguese, but of
Orientals. “Of a population of 76,000,
only a scant 2,000 claim a dubious
Portuguese origin. ‘

CONSERVATIVE .PREFPRS ~ ROW-
ELL LIQUOR POLICY.

The thrill of last week was caused
by the bolting of Col, H. A. ©, Machin,
ConseryatiV@ member for Kenora, who
took the @pportunity of the Speech
from the Throne address to denounce
the Ontaflo Temperance Ac’ and the
present Conservative Government.
The speaker stated that he was sorry
that he did not support Hon. Mr. Row-
ells’ “Abolish the Bar” measuro a few
years ao. That was the proper thing
to do; the people in the Province had
no use for the bar. The Colonel main-
tained that the Government should
compensate the liquor people who had
been put Out of business by the On-
tario Teniperance Act. He also sug-
gested a system of Government ven-
dors to sell iiquor in each manicipal-
ity. He was layish in his praise of the
late Sir James Whitney and strong in
his denunciation of the present Hearst
Government. ‘

FIRST DIVISION IN TWO SESSIONS

The first division sinco the session
of 1917 took place during the debate
on the Speech from the Throne, when
‘an amendment proposed by Mr, De-
wart, demanding a return to the old
municipal procedure for the prepara-
tion of voters’ lists, was voted down
by a straight party vote of 58 to 25.

This the Day of Young Men,

In thelr enthusiasm, some well
stricken in years have been. heard_to
argue thut this otght to be called the

to be not only old but» foolish to at-
tempt to-make that out, Youth will
still be served. It is really moré ém-
phaticiilly than evér before the day of

of handling bye-elections during the
last couple of years. He expressed
curlosity-as*to the proposed amend-
ments to the Ontario Temperance Act,
and deplored the fact that there was
no prospect of the one mill-war tax
boing removed. In regard to the war

tax, however, the Provincial Treas- |

urer subsequentiy jntimated that the
same -would be discontinued.

The debate on the Address was com-
pleted on Wednesday,,and the House
has now settled down to business,

BUDGET,

The Budget brought down by thé
BN ee Treasurer claims 4 surplus
of 1,800710.68, which he obtains by
deducting. ordinary’ expenditures — of

$17,460,404.05 from ordinary revenue!

of $19,270,123.71. He maintains that
the: provinoe possessed liquid assets’
to the value of $71,000,000; ‘that its
toal liabilities.amounted to $75;000,000;
and that therefore tenet debt remdin-

fed at. only $4,000,000, . He estinfated

the resources of the Province at. $600,-
000,000, and the’ receipts and expendi-
tures for the coming year at $18,400,-

Proof that Some Women

Mrs. Etta Dorion, of Ogdensburg, Wis., says: aN

les have entirely cured me,
All women who have female trouble of any kind should try
Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vegetable Compound.”

How Mrs. Boyd Avoided an Operation:

Canton, Ohio.—‘‘T suffered from a female trouble which
caused me much suffering, and two doctors decided that
I would have to go through an operation before I could

ey mother, who had been helped by Lydia FE. Pink-

fore submitting to an operation. It relieved mefrom
my troubles so I can do my house work without any

Travelers who «me that way and
ascended and descaded the long hill,
with the ereek anu the bridge at its
foot, always turned thé? heads to look
at the old stone house pult in colonial,
Gays, In summer it wis civered with
vines and stood in the shade of the
pear trees, and in summer the “girl u-
der the hill” ‘wae oftenest caufit
sight of. — *

Why the “girl under the bill” instead
of Molly: Thatcher? Well, travelcs
would have it go, and nobody knew
just why. She had been called so al
sixteen, and she was still belng called
so at twenty. It was necessary only

| to inquire af any house fn the village
beyond the creek to know she was the
duughter of old Murt Thatcher, the
pensioner, and a motherless girl.

Sometimes travelers saw the old
}man on the porch and the dsughter
| reading to him a8 he smoked bis pipes

sometimes she was working among
the flowers In the yard; sometimes
from the open windows of the house,
they heard het singing and paused to
listen... When strangers met her on
the road as she went to and from the
village with her basket, they remem-
bered that she had halr that shone
like gold In the sun, and a mouth that
smiled; and eyes that reminded them
of those of a deer. Sometimes, when
| too-curlous young man pestered the
postmistress for information he re-
celyed the reply:

“She's ‘smart and handsome and
good, and it’s no use for you to waste
your time, Molly has never looked
at any fellow éwice.”

One summer day the girl under the
bill carried an apronful of weeds

_ fromthe flower beds out of the gate
j and emptied ,them in the highway.
| Just as she did so an auto driven b
ln young man came chugging up
| hill, She looked fairly into (ithe
! young man’s eyes, and he into hers.
| The look did not last ten seconds, but it
| made her-heart beat faster a8 she
turned away, and his as he continued
| his journey.

‘An hour Inter, the old father hob-
| bled out on the porch where the girl
' eat with her chin on her hand, staring

{nto vacancy, and sald:

“] thought you might have gone to
forforfenfonfecfasfeoterfeotecfortorlorlorlonlers the store, I haven't heard you sing-
“Ing for a long time.”

“T was just—just thinking,” she re-
plied as she got up and ran away.

Autos were not a rare sight on that
highway. A dozen passed up or down
the hill every day, and no one minded
them. The girl under the hill had
never gone to the gate out of curlos-
ity. If seated on the porch she had
ot raised her eyes. Aji at once, now,
she found herself Istening, and was
vexed. She found herself.at the gate,
and stamped her foot as she turned
rway.,: Thot young man had black,
hair and dark eyes; he was young and
hondsome; he was surely a gentle-
man; he—. But to-break the chain of
thought, Molly.selved the broom and
began to sweep the porch so vigorous-
ly-that-her father called out from the
{interior of the house: 5
| “Hey, girl, What's the matter with
2 you today? You swept the porch only
Yan hoursago. Better gave the broom.”

Two days had gone by since Mollle
kad thrown the weeds in the rond and
the young man in the auto came again.
The girl was training a vine at the
corner of the house, and she heard

turned away, but she knew he was

most come to a stop, but she would
not Jook up. Then the-power was in-
creased, the ¢hug went louder and
faster, and she stood and listened un-
til the sounds died away in the dis-
tance. ~~

“That. fellow ‘pretty near got stuck
on, the hill,” said the father as Molly
came around to the porch. -

It was just 9% well for “that fel-
icw” that he Wign't there to seé the
toss of her head arid the snap in her
eyes. She believes that he had al-
most stopped to state at her, and she
was rejoiced>that her attitude had
been one of disdain:

That is, after thinking {t over, she
didn't know-whether she was or not.

Three days jiter, as. she sat sewing

“Last year there were two or three
accidents along here, and it took the
men half a day to make repairs... If
they've got machines how that they
can repair with an old ax in ten min-
utes it's a big gain. I guess there's
some buttermilk from the churning
this morning, und if—”

“Thanks—thanks, ‘but I must be go-
ing. Very kind of you, indeed.”

If the old pensioner's eyes had not
been so dim he might have seen a
young man blushing like a girl ns he’
walked towards the gate, but he
didn't see, and in his hospitality he,
called out:

“Call ngain any time you break
down. If I ain't out bere, take the ax
and use ft as long as you want to.”

“Father, how could you spenk that
way to him?” exclaimed the daughter
at his elbow as soon a8 the Intch of
the gate had clicked.

“Lordy, but what have Y done now?
A young feller’s auto breaks down in
front of the house and we lend him
an ax and tell him he can have it
again any time. You are always ready
to give buttermilk to tramps, and I
wondered why you didn't come out
and offer him a gliass.- I “don't want
folks to think I’ve turned stingy {n my
old age.”

During the next month Molly
Thatcher heard from the gossips of
the villnge that the young man was
connected with the big new factory
five miles awny. She got sight of him
and his nuto at lenst every other day,
but he peered In vain for her. She
had a maid's curiosity, but she nlso
had a mald’s timidity. At nine o'clock
one moonlight night, as the villige
lights were golng out and a strange
ailence was creeping over the land,
she walked down to .the gate and
leaned upon it. She had not been
standing there ten minutes when the
hum of an auto came to her ears from
tho crest of the hill a quarter of a
mile away. She had heard that the
dark-haired man sometimes rode about
at night. She would walt until the
machine came nearer and then step
behind a rose bush.

“pyff. Puff... Chug.” And then the

rl heard a’ sharp snap, and some
‘thing told her that the auto was com-
ing down the hill uncontrolled. She
sprang through the gate and saw it
coming. There was only one person
{n the vehicle, and intuftlon and the
moonlight identified him. “fhe course
was fairly straight, but the brake was
not working. Second by second the
speed Increased, and as the machine
came whizzing past she ralsed her
tand above her head and screamed
to the man:

“Jump for your life!
killed at the bridge!”
, For the fraction of a second he
looked into her eyes and smiled, and
she had to turn and selze hold of the
gate while she walted for what must
happen at the foot of the hjll and the
parrow bridge. And when the crash
came she screamed to her father, doz-
{ng on the porch, and ran screaming
down the path fhe wild auto had fol-
lowed. When neighbor aroused nelgh-
bor and half a dozen men gathered at
the wreck they found the girl under
the -hill séated on the grass and the
bead of the unconscious young man in
her Inp.

‘Fe is dead!” some of them whis-
pered after, a look. .

“No! Nol It can't be so!” she al-
most flercely_replied.

“He must be taken to.the fnn and a
doctor called.” fee aes lt

“No, take him to our honse. Run
for a mattress. Lift him carefully. If
he hadn't. been coming down the hill
In hopes—in hopes to see—to see—”

“Cut and bruised and suffering from
the shock, ‘but no bones broken,” re-
ported the doctorto young Marshall's
fplends.next ‘morning, “Eeave him
fight here and don’t worry about
him.” é

Two weeks Inter, 2s the young man
was able to ride away in the auto of
e friend he said to the old pensioner
before departing:

“J may not want to borrow*your ax,
but I should Mke your permission to
call again.” ~ 2 eed

“Why, of course, of course, I tell
Molly we must be neighborly.”

Waterpiane Piloting. _

Describing the difference in the
operation of a waterplane and an air-
plane, one pilot said:

“Piloting a waterplane is slightly
different ‘from piloting) an ordinary
lnnd machine. It is sometimes’ very
dificult to alight on a choppy sea in”

5

the case of an airplane’ fitted with

fldats, especially if the alighting has to
be done across wind. If tlie floats do
not ‘land’ simultancously—that Is, if.
one etrikes’a wave—the result may be
disastrous; a float may be torn’off and
the machine spun into themwater.. With
‘a flying boat—which {s much more sea-
worthy—there is not this difficulty.
Certainly ‘landing}.on the water ts not
so ensy as'alighting on Iand. Water ts
so véry hard if you do not hit in the |

-| right way, as I once found out from

personal experiences with a seaplane
on the south coast.”

There is more Gatarrh in this sec-|
tion of the’country. than all other dis=
eases put together, and ‘until the last
few years was supposed to be incur-
able, For a great many years doctors
pronounced it a local © disease and
prescribed local remedies, and by con-
stantly failing to cure with ldécaftreat-
ment, pronounced it jncurable, Science
has proven Catarrh to be. a consti-
tutional disease, and therefore re-
quires constitutional treatment. Hall’s
Catarrh Cure, manufactured by>F. Ji
Cheney & Co., Toledo, ‘Ohio, is the
only Constitutional cure on the mar-
ket. It is taken internally in doses
from 10 drops to-a teaspoonful, _ It
acts directly on the blood *_ and
mucous surfaces of the, system. They
offer one hundred dollars for any case
it fails to'cure, Send for circulars and

weigh scales cogfing $500, and charged
