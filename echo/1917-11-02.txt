When others rushed into the motor car industry,
Robert Gray bided his time.

Gray—the Industry and
its Builder

~ Our fathers and grandfathers rode in Gray Carriages
—and found them built on honor and character.

In 1855, William Gray built the first of them—

built them so well that..Gray quality became
proverbial.

Growing up in this atmosphere of big business, of
successful enterprise, of worthy endeavour, was

Robert Gray.

Others experimented—on the motorist.
Others gained the reputation of a day—and lost it.

Robert Gray knew -that the car bearing his name
must have the same underlying qualifications as the
Gray carnage—so he waited.

Dort-—at the Same Time,

Paralleling the growth of Gray in Canada, was a
similar institution»in the United States.

Blue Ribbon Buggies were to Americans what
Gtay Buggies were to Canadians.

J. D. Dott,’ too, was building in Flint, aé ‘Robert
Gray was building in Chatham.

J. D. Dorf, too, was analyzing the* motor car in-

dustry.
In 1915, Robert Gray decided that a good motor

@ar could be builf and sold, at a reasonable price.

In 1915, J. D. Dort, studying. the: situation from
the.same angle, came to the same conclusion.

The two men met. © Their identical views. and

After Such Preparation—

Wath two institutions so solidly founded the first
Gray-Dort was built.

Is it any. wonder that in three days the entire 1916
output was sold>

It was'té:be-expected that a doubled output for
1917 was heavily ‘oversold. :

The output for 1918 is doubled again anda may
be inadequate.

—A number of milk distributors gave
gaye Informations to the special Milk
Committee atthe Food Controller's
office in Ottawa last week. It appear-
ed to be the concensus of opinion am
ong those examined by=P. B. Tustin, |
chairman of the committee, tat if a
‘central or concentration system of de-
livery was adopted for the distribution
of milk, there would be a saving of a
cent a quart. This would. enable tlie
distributor to pay the farmer one-half
cent per quart more, nnd at the same
time give customers milk at one-balf
cent per quart cheaper. The wit-
nesses approximated the yearly loss in
milk. bottles from $1,000 to $10,000
chiefly: due to ~ corelessness of the
consumer, but cased also by theft
of bottles, weather conditions and fac-
tory breakage. e

“As for the corps generally,” ania
Mr. Lyon, “it js in.a high state of

“In ‘northern France and Flanders,

well-informed student of war on the

EXPORT OF FISH. |

 

 

Editor of The Echo:— {

We wish to také™*exception to the
resolution passed by Border Chamber
of Commerce at a special meeting held |
by that body, calling on the Food
Controller, the Department of Marine
end Fisheries and the Ontario Fish |
Commission to at once put ao stop to
the continued export of fish from Can-
ada to ths United Statea, Now to a
disinterested reader and a person who}
is not acquainted with the existing}
conditions, this would seem the right
and just thing to do. But let us look
a little deeper into the matter, For
{nstance, we will suppose that an em-
Dargo were placed on fish going into
the United States, what would be the |
consequence. In the first place we
would have no adequate: fish= houses
to send‘our catches of fish in-the event}
refrigerator plants to take care of}
the fish when caught; centers of dis-}
¢ribution where fishermen could ship
their catch to. We on Pelee Island
have no way to ship our fish only by
steamboat. We have no, ice or tanks}
fixed up for shipping fish in that way,
and if we had we would have no place
to send our catches of fish In th event
of an embargo being at once placed on

 

 

 

fish. If the Government contemplates
any suchmove as ¢hat it would be well
for them to give the matter a thor-
ough» investigation Fishermen can-
not help the conditions that . exist.
Thosé little onehorse fish houses

could no take caresof a small fraction
of the fish business at the present
time, and the consequences would be
that the larger bulk of the catch-would
be left to spoil on the fishermen’s }y
hends Thanking you, Mr. Editor, for |’
space. Believé me, I remain

Very respectfully,

Discovery at the Front in France
Proves Close German Watch
On Canada:

 

A newspaper found on a German
prisoner who was taken by the Can-

shows how close a watch the Huns

contained a nows despatch, purport-
ing to comoe.from Ottawa, which told
-of the passing of the Military Service,
Act just two days after the Act was
passed by Parllament here. ec

This little discovery is regarded
here as a proof of the importance

Jarvis journeyed from the little rail-

drawn by two iron gray horses. He
was the only passenger for the beach,
and he shook about in the huge vehi-
clo like the proverbial pea in a barrel.
At the entrance to a narrow sandy
Jane shaded by wind blown cedars,
under which the marsh grass straggled
sparsely, the stage stopped.

“All out!” sang the driver lustily.
“Goin' to the beach, ye sald?’ He
peered down at Jarvis with beady
black eyes beneath thatches of white
eyebrows,

“Yes; Edgewater cottage. Straight

while he threw his luggage to the

“Edgewnter cottage? That'll be th

“Much obliged. Goodby!’

Ottawa, October 26th.—An order-in-
Council has been passed by the Do-
minion Government authorizing regu-
lations. issued by the Fuel Controller
for Canada respecting \tha ‘impor-
tations and sale of coal, which went
into effect on the 1st day of Novem
ber..

Provision Is made for the licensing
of all importers and dealers in coal
now doing business in Canada, and
that may hereafter desire to do so.
Application must be made to the Fuel
Controller before the 21st of Novem-
ber, by registered letter, for a dealer's
or importer’a permit. Heavy penalties
are provided for doing business with-
out permit. Provision ts also made
for the cancellation of permits in
cases where any dealer has been foun :
guilty of giving short weights or
where any other sufficient cause ex
ists. rae

Under the regulation gyery mine
operator in Canada must « forthwith
enter into an agreement with the Fuel
Controller fixing the maximum pri-
ces. per ton he may chage for the
output of his mine

Maximum Profits Fixed.

The most far-reaching provisions of
the new regulations are those deal:
ing with packers’ commissions and
profits. Brokers are allowed a max-
imum of 30 cents per ton for their
services. Wholesalers, a maximum of
35 cents per ton; and retail dealers a

sum not exceeding 50 cents per ton.
These maximum profits are allowed
over an? above isonable overhead
and handling charges, and and ef-
fectually do away with profiteering in
coal.

The regulations also set forth the
method to. be addpted by wholesale
and reta{l- dealers conl to arrive
and the cost prices thereof. Every
two weeks am average will be struck
by such dealers of the cost of all coal
an hand;which will be the governing
price for the ensuing period of two
weoks.

Three Tons fer customers.

Stringent regulations are made In
regard to the hoarding of coal. It is
ordered that between the months of
Aprikand September, inclusive in each
year, nQ consumer shall obtatin any
quantity \of coal’ in excess of the_es-
timated supply for two months with
a&-maximum, allowance of three tons.

Provision is also made whereby
doalers may procure a.formal. state-
ment from their customers to.the ef-
fect that they are not over-supplied ac-
cording to the resolution

May Requisition Supplies.

The most: drastic. part of-the regu:
lations. is perhaps that dealing. with
cases of emergency when the Fuel
Controller will “Have: power to re-
quisition any quantity, of coal in-the
possession of any customer in excess
of the legal supply pérmitted’ under
the regulations, It is not the inten:
tion of the Fuel Controller to disturb
those who have their winter supply
of fuel Jald in except in case of emer-
gency when the public interest may
demand that they; shall)share the ex:
cess supply with thefr nefghbors. .In
working out this pant of the regula-
tions the Mayor, Reeve, Warden’ or
overseér of any, muhicipality, may be
made the arent -of the Fuel’ Con-
troller. F
No Frivolous Complaints.

A provision of the regulations is
no charge glall be laid against any.
coal deer or broker without first
submitting the fact td the Fuel ‘Con-
troller and obtaining his consent An
writing.

This’ is to, avold frivolous com-
plaints and to enable the Fuel’ Con-
troller to consider complaints in the
Nght2of information as to. costs, ete.,

The Best Sticker.

A Washington business man, ‘says

»John did not show pp at the office
