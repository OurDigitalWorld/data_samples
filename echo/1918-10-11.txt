Attractions,

Nearly five thousand people throng:
ed the Fair grounds at Harrow on
Wednesday, the second day of the
Harrow Falr. Both days were among
the pleasantest this fall and people |:
tdok advantage of that to gather at
the township show, which has always
been known as the great annual hand-
shaking event of the County of Essex.
Every feature was pleasant, andthe
day wis one round of joy. {t was like
motor show to see the hundreds of
automobiles parked around the inside
of the track. One director sald some-
thing as he looked’ over the dense
crowds from the judges’ stand when
he murmured: “This is a real Fair.”

The exhibits themselves were not so
plentiful as usual, as it was simply
impossible for farmers with their Inck
of help, to take the time to prepare
a large display. However, everything
shown was meritorious. Horses were
light, and the judges fond them not
ap to usual condition. The hot sum-
mer and-dry pasture fad. thefr, in-
fluence also on the cattle, but the
show. of these-animals was large and

largely attended owing {0 the threat-

served at one o'clock sharp, was ex-
quisite. The party broke up at 230,
every one going home with the feeling
that a very pleasant time was spent.

of the daughter of Ernest Fox: “Laura
