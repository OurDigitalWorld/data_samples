TEACH PATRIOTISM
THROUGH HISTORY

Hon. Dr. Cody, Ontario Minister of
Education, has made the following an-
nouncements in. reference to next
year's examinations:

“The reinstatement of British and
Canaidlan history as one of the sub-
jects in the Junior High School En-
trance examination. for 1919 is a mat-
ter of {mportance to the teachers and
the schools. The department has made
arrangements which, it Is believed,
|will stimulate and direct the study of
history in the schoola. The value of
the subject in promoting patriotism in
providing material for a clear grasp
of Canadian civicw and in expounding
Canada's imperial. relations and her |},
place in the empire 1s generally re-
cognized. A clireular will shortly be
issued, which will contain a definite
outline of the course, both in British
and Canadian history.”

In the introduction to the circular
will be found a brief and instructivo
exposition of the method of teaching.
fiistory. : x

“The course {i grammar for the
fourth form of the Public and Separ-
ate schools has been lightened and
amended by omitting parsing and
the paper set in-thé subject for the
High schoo) Entrance examination
will emphasize the composition of the}
principles of correct speech.”

| THE UNDERFED

ARM help is scarce, but. this condition can be relieved
to a marked degree by using machines that accomplish
more work in a given time with less man power. «

Why should the farmer cling to horses—a slow, expensive
means of power—when every other business is adopting
the truck and thereby reducing the cost of hauling, spseding
up deliveries, and saving for human needs the food that
the horses would otherwise consume?

The motor driven truck*ean work constantly at maximum
load under the burning summer sun, or in the coldest weather.
Untike the horse it needs no rests while working, it eats only
while in actual use; and when the day’s work is done it

uires very little attention, and leaves you free for other
“Chores” about ‘the place. Then, it can be housed in one-
quarter the space of the horses, wagon and harness it replaces,

It is a mistaken idea that a truck is useful only for driving
upon paved roads, Tlie Ford can be driven all over the farm,
and used for hauling grain, potatoes, fruit, roots, fertilizer,
wood, ‘stock, milk or any other product. The speed it
travels, the time it saves, and its Now upkeep cost appeal
very strongly to all users of the Ford Truck. If you need
help, order-your Ford One Ton Truck today.

Judging by the present activity in
our littie thriving village, one would
tilnk that we were on Michigan Ave,,

But do not be deceived, my dear read-
er, waoat you see here are not Iimou-
sinea, but’ & procession of heavy loads
of tomatoes, wending their way to-
wards Canning Factory. The
farmers are Jubilant, a Ijtt!e_fortune
ls awaiting them, reward of their
labor under a hot summer sun- D.
C. Munro, manager of the Valley Can-
ning Co,, of uiis place, is all smiles,
although he has his factory running
night and day to keep up with the
increasing delivery Of the red “Pomme
d'Amour.” If no early frost is felt and
yeather permita, it will be one of the
begt years for the tomato growersand
for the canning industry In this sec-
tlon. The Helnz Co. is not having the
game suceeaa. Whether this is due to
e hot and dry summer orto the
erlence of the growers, we do
n of, but we are.inclined to be-
Ilave that it is due to both. Farmers
do not get discouraged at this first
quas! failure, but let the company, by
giving {t another triql, show you that
the cuctthbor industry is°a paying
one for you. When the big sugar fac-
tory waa built at Wallaceburg, bis
farmers of Lambton and Kent couptios
were vefy suspicious of the good
stories\related to them~by the agents
of the company after the firstiand gec-
ond failure, but at tast they leaned
to grow sugar beets, and today they
are gotting rich by It, although they
pay to have the work done—Accord-
ing to all appearances, Labor Day
will be a gala day at Loflselleville
Great preparations are being made for
the big picnic which will be held here
on that day.. There will’ be amuse
ments of all kinds. Refreshments
will be served on the grounds. A good
dinner and supper “a la carte” is ex-
pecting you. More than that, lunch

Old residents here lang
of the Karr family’s claim to
any of the - property occupied by
tha Boyce store or in connection with
it. The facts in connection with the
disposal of this property aré.as fcl-
lows:
tel there 46 years ago, he bought the
|place, the deed being made out to his
wife, on & mortgage held by the late
Daniel Wright. Mr, Wright had to
foreclose.the mortgage, and the prop-
erty was sold’ by him “to James Rae,
uncle of the late Mrs. Tomas Fer-
Tiss, Mr. Rae after sold it to a
Frenchman, Who. kept a tavern there,
|and he to the late John Thrasher, who
also managed the hotel for some time.
Mr. Thrasher sold # to John McAfeo,
who toré down the old log building
and built a frame store, and sold it'to
Hz W. Allan, M.P., late Inspector of
@ustoms for, Windsor District, T. B.
Adam4, the present owner, bought it
from him, This entirely disposes of
the story that any outsider has. any
claim to the property.

Ths lye was being used in wasting
and had been left on the porch. The
mother had no sooner turned her back
to enter the house when the little girl
slipped out, and childlike grasped the
can and put it up to “ner mouth: to
drink it. A. quantity of the powder
entered her mouth and badly ‘burned
hor. In spite of all that could be
done, she gradually grew weaker until

EIGHT PECKS TO AGRE BEST
WHEAT SEEOING RATE.

Experiments covering a period of 19
yoars to determine the most economt-
cal amount of seed wheat to sow to
tho acre show that § pecks haa been
the most profitable amount, This has
been done at the Ohfo Experiment
Station. In the date of seeding teats
from 3 to 10 pecks to the acre have
boon tried with a 19yéar average of
30 bushels from. the 8peck rate while
26 bushels hae been the average yield
for the 3-peck sowing; the amounts
then gradually rise for ench addition-
al peck sown per acre but less than
one-half bushel more has teen har.
vested to the acre with 10 pecks than
with 8 pecks

Tests to determine a combined date
and rate of seeding using 6, 8 and 10
péecks, to the acre on five different
dates, September 16th, 26th and Octo-
ber 25th have been carried on for 2
years, Taking the average for the
short-time experiment the largest
yield is from the s¢eding made on
September 26th with 8 pecks to the
acre; in averaging the three ratea of
seeding, September 26th has proved
tie best date at the Ohio Experiment
Station. oe

STATE FARMS YIELD
BIG CROP OF OATS

Yields of onts as reported from the
Ohio Experiment Station and county
experiment farms point to some of
the higheat recorded for a number of
years, At the Ohlo Station a number
of tests show from_90 to 110 bushels
to the acre; at the Paulding County
Experiment Farm’ more™ than 100
bushels have bean grown and from
75 to 8bushel yielda were harvested
at the Miam{f County Experiment
Farm.

Agronomists point ‘out that the past
season has been on@ of the most fav-
orable for oats in’ many years, there
being no storms before harvest time
to reduce the yields. Parly spring
and summer conditiona, too, were fay-
orable, being dry at seeding time but
coo! and moist throughout the grow-
ing period. P

Heavy ylelds of oats até reported
from many sections of Ohio, which

ation, making possible the use of oats
