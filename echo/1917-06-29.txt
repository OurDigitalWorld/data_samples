The Vim and Vitality One Gets
From Oats

- THE ENERGY FOOD

There js something in oats which creates
opirit and energy. No other grain cambring
results like them. Everyone knows what
oats do for horses, They bave the same
effect on man.

An extract of onts is employed asa tonic.
A diet of onts multiplies one's vitality.
That's why energetic men—men of vin
and spirit—are said to “feel their oats.”

In Quaker Onts the finest oats—Canndinn
grown—are subjected to 62’ siftings. Just
the rich, plump grains ore used, There js
only. tetspounds of Quaker Oats in a bushel.

These grains havet aximum of rich-
ness and ener. T also the most
delicious. To ent Quaker Oats once a day
for h month will show to the limit what
tonic effects, what bubbling. vitality one
can pet from ogtmenl, One never imows
bow good oat food is. or what it can do, unr
tilhe tries Quaker Oats.

with all the ability God has given us
for its entire abolition in this our Do-
minion. 2 .

2. That being dissatisfied with the
Provincial Act as
regards the {importation of ale-holic
liquorm we resolve to ally ourselves.
actively with the present agitation’ for
Dominion-wide prohibition; ~ also to
work for an amendment which shall
prevent doctors from becomizg liquor

to curry out the law, and that will
suppress more efficiently the illicit

tion In possession of the Provincial W.
Cc, T. U. in regard to vice conditions
existing in soldiers’ camps in Eng-

which, some years ago; abdlished the
wet canteen in soldiers’ camps.

Men soon become the victims of ner-

doctor calls {t. Some heve no reserve
strength {fn their systems to bear the
strnin; others overtax what strength
they have. If you find that you are
nervous and not sure of yourself, that
you sleep badly, and wake up tired and
aching, your nerves ore out of order,
Other signs are inability to take prop-
er interest In your work; your appe-
tite {5s fickle; your back feels weak,
and you are greatly depressed in spir-
its. One or more of these’ signs méan
that you should take prompt steps to
stop. mischief bo nourishing the
nerves with the food they thrive on,
namely the rich, red blood made by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. These pjlls
have cured thousands of cases Of
nervous disorders, including nervous
prostration, neurelgia, St. Vitus dance
and partiol paralysis. Here is an ex-
ample, P. H, Callan, a well known
business man in Coleman, P. EB, L.,
snys:—"Il owe my present health, if
not life itsel¥, to Dr, Williams’ Pink
Pills. I had always- been, an active
man, ond when I began to run down
in health paid little attention to it as
I thought it only a temporary weak-
ness. Ags time passed, however, I
found myself growing worse, and con-
sulted a doctor, who seid thet I was
not only badly run down, but’ that my
nervous system was badly shattered,
J lost flesh, my appetite was poor, I
slept badly and notwithstanding the
doctor’s- treatment grew so weak that
I had to leave my business and was
confined to. the house. Time went on
and I was steadily growing weaker,
and my friends were nll greatly alarm-
ed for my condition. “In this condition
I was strongly recommended tov try
Dr, Williams’ Pink, Pills, and’as the
doctor's medicine wag not helping me
I decided to do so, By the time I had
used threo boxes I could te)! that they
were helping me.. When I had taken
eight boxes of the pills I felt able to
attend to my business agoin, and peo-
ple were surprised to see me out. I
continued the use of the pills until I
had taken twelve boxes, by which time
I_was feeling ag well as ever J did,
and was being congratulnted by all
my friends on my full restoration to
health. I feel now that if T had used
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills at the outset
I would not only have saved much
money spent in doctor's bills}* but
would have had reaewed health soon-
er. I cannot speak too highly of this
medicine, and would recommend it to
every man who feels weak, nervous,
or run down.” x

IMPLEMENTS.

EXTRA USES FOR

 

Sonie pieces of farm machinery can
be utilized for more than one parpone.
When the investment happens to be
comparatively large, and the period
through which the machine can be
operated for the main purpose {s rela-
tively short, another adaption merely
affords an opportunity to extend its
usefulness, A manure spreader may
be converted into a wagon which pos-
sesses o desirgble feature in the-un-
loadifg device. The cylinder {s first
removed from the box and a suitable
end board set in place.

When the wagon is taken to the
cellar the endwboard \ia removed and
the roots yolfed into the cellar merely
by turning the shaft whico connets
with the apron. ?

The following are some special
enses in which this implement has
been made to fit in with other work
than the spreading of manure:

Hauling and unlonding turnips.

Hauling potatoes which have been
picked and placed in: barrels.

Hauling and unloading roots which

A FARMER'S®* TALK.

 

Nelson Parliament, who, ever since |.

his entry into the Legislature in 1914,
has’ proved himself ao public-spirited
member of one of the most capable
spokesman for the farming community
in the Legislature, has been speaking
at Wingham in connection with the
annual meoting of the Provincial Lib-
eral Association of that riding. Mr.
Parliament, a working farmer him-
self, emphasized the serious. duty
placed upon farmers in this time of
crisis and the responsibility of pro-
ducing food for the salvation, not of
this coyntryyalone, but of _countrica
overseas. “ What atone time might
have been considered more or less of)
a cémmercial propositign had become
a question of vital public interest and
the farmers of the country, sometimes:
called “patriots” theoretically, ha
actually found themselves now in’ that
proud but diferent role. ) :

evening, his son-in-law, A. D, Pettiford,
being one of the students receiving a
degree of Bachelor of Laws.

During the electric storm on Satur-
day lightning struck Edward “Lock-
wood’s barn, knocking out the end
and running down a post, setting fire
to the hay. By means of the tele-
phone a general alarm was sent out
and neighbors soon guthered in force
and put out the blaze before it had
got beyond control. The damage am-
ounted to about $70.

Thursday morning fire was discov-
ered in the roof of Charles Salter’s
kitchen and gained a good deal of
force before a sufficient fighting gang

gathered to. put it out. The handy
elephone alarm came {nto play again
and it was necessary for the fire
fighters to lift off the metal roof before
the fire*nest could be reached. © This
done, it was only the, work of a few
minutes to put ‘out the blaze. The
fire was caused by a defective chim-
ney.
