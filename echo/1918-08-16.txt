153 Papineau Ave., Montreal.

“For three years, I suffered great
pain in the lower part of my body,
with swélling or bloating. I saw a
specialist, who carefully examiocd
me and gave me several tonics to
take, which didnot help me, Thea
he told me I must undergo an oper-
ation. This, I refused to permit.

I heard about ‘Frusta-dizes’ and
the wonderfal results it was giving
because (Ais medicine is made from
Sruit juices, so decided to try it.

The t box gave great relief; and
I continued the treatment, taking
six boxes more. Now, my health is
excellent —I am’ free of pain and
swelling—and I give ‘Fruit-sa-tives’
my warmest thanks”,

The bigger Comfort bar means more soap for the money than
ever before. Think of that—in war-time! The quality is the
same—the kind that gives Comfort the largest sale in Canada.

COMFORT SOAP .

Ask for the Bigger Bar—your grocer can easily supply you. No premiomg
with the wrappers, in war-time. If yon are-still getting the smaller bar, -
however, its wrapper is still good for premiums.
Use Comfort Soap and get a brighter, cleaner, easier wash.

On the Eve of :
a Wedding

; Mistaken Identity Caused a
Complication

By JOHN Y. LARNED
§ ddO4

Arthur MacKnight left his office at
the conclusion of business hours and
went to bis bachelor apartments with
a light heart. He would sleep that
olght in those apartments for the Inst
Ame, for be was about to be married.

MacKnight’s love came at first sight
He had made a flying trip abroad the
summer before, had seen an American
girl in the Kursaa) In Lugano, Switzer-
land, had followed ber to Lucerno
and had secured an Introduction. Aft
er two weeks golng abont in tho
same party he became engaged to her
and the day after his engagement was
obliged to leave her at Montreux to
catch a steamer for America.

His flancee, Miss Leona Denton, re-
mained abroad three months longer.
Her home wns in a different city from
that of MacKnight. and since he was
very closely confined to business tho
lovers saw very little of-each other,
Therefore when. he succeeded in ar-
ranging for n wedding to take place in®
the near future he was made a very
happy man.

Consent that thelr daughter should
ally herself with a man of whom she
had seen so little and about whose an-
tecedents so little was known was
given by Miss Denton’s parents with
reluctance MacKnight bad been able
to give no information about his fam-
lly, had not a relative that he had ever
seen, and his statements about his
childhood were conflicting. The truth
was that the poor fellow wns a found-
ling, he knew he was a foundling and
shrank from admitting the fact. - Nev-
ertheless he finally did so to bis flan-
cee. But she who had come to love
him With ag much fervor as he loved
her did not dare, to communicate the
fact to her parents lest they insist
upon her breaking off the match. Con-
sequently he was to be married with
this secret kept by himself and Miss
Denton from those who had a right to
know It.

MacKnight reached the city where
the Dentons lived too late to see his
fiancee till morning. Before going to
bed he sat smoking in the lounging
room of the hotel where he stopped. It
wns not a first class house by any
means. He had chosen it because it
was the only hostelry that was not at
a Considerable distance from the Den-
tons. While he was smoking a man en-
tered th@ room and looked about bim
uneasily. His gaze fell upon Mac-
Knight, and he seemed surprised. Mac:
Knight. was also surprised. Between
the two men there tvas o striking re
semblance. Thelr complexion, hair,
height, build ~were the same. Their
clothes were entirely different, Mac-
Knight's being plain, those of the other
flashy. é

Tho man passed out of the room, nnd
soon after MacKnight went upstalrs
and to bed.

He was awakened by a knocking at

   

. eS ee ee, ne
He bad been expected much carter,
and his not coming bad occasioned
some worry. He propoxed to give his
explanation to Leona privately, and
his not accOunting for his delay at once
made a bad impression on the rest of
tho family. As soon as the young
couple were left alone he told his
bride to be the story of hls arreat. She
listened eagerly and at bis conclusion
seemed much dejected. Her parents
had not ceased to hold up to her the
risk she ron in marrying o man sho
knew so little about, who bad no fam-
ily connections and whose childhood
he had falled to atcount-for. Shoe
dreaded lest they would now refuse to
permit the wedding to come off as had
been arranged.

The pair, after consultation, joined
Mr, and Mrs. Denton and made a clean
breast of what had occurred. It wag
evident that both the father and moth-
er. regarded the matter a8 a confirma-
tion of their fears. MacKnight was
informed that the wedding day must
be put off indefinitely, by which he
understood that It would not take place
at all with Mr, and Airs, Denton’s con-
sent. After further consultation be-
tween the lovers, they agreed that the
wedding as arranged must be abandon-
ed. Leona was too distressed to talk
about the future, but she surely would
not go back on her lover without the
best of reasons,

Tho next morning. MacKnight went
to the office of his lawyer and was
much surprised and disheartened to
learn that It would be difficult to prove
that ho was not the man be was sup-
posed to ‘be. ‘True, if he were the
criminal, MacKnight must be account-
ed for, But might not MacKnight be
both himself and the criminal? Per-
sons bad been known to Jead double
lives before, and why not in this case?
At any rate, there must be a trial,
which would attract @ great deal of
attention, and, even if the prisoner
were acquitted, many persons would
believe him guilty.

Leona had an Ioterview with her
parents, in which her father expressed
the opinion” that there was something
wrong about her lover and that his
arrest was fortunate in that it had
saved her from a union with o crim-
inal. The girl came from this inter-
view feeling that no matter what ver
dict a jury might give with respect to
the charge against her lover her father
would believe him. guilty.

Such was the situation of this young
couple on the eve of the wedding day,
that had been set, with all tho attend-
ant expected happiness’ But three
days intervened before the intended
nuptials. A compromise had been ef-
fected between Leona and her parents
that the inyitatidns should be. recalled

the next day. The lovers went for a

final conference with the lawyer. He
advised his client to Jump his bail, go
to a forelgn country under an assumed
name and‘begin-lfe anew. :
MacKnight, heartsick over the affair,
dreading a trial and his inability to
account for his past childhood, decided
to act on this advice. It therefore re-
mained with Leona whether she would
sbore his fate or endure a lifelong
separation from the man she loved.
It was a question which suffered the
more, MacKnight or the girl, whose’
life would be wrecked if shevsetood by
him and would be blighted If she gave
him up, A‘few hours of del!beration
were sufficient for a decision. She
‘agreed to marry her lover secretly and
to go into oblivion with him.
MacKnight was leaving her home

his door. Rising, be opened it, and,| after receiving this decigion when he

there stood a couple of -policemen.
They entered the room and directed
MacKnight to dress himself. He asked
what it all meant, but the only infor-
mation he recelvéd was that ho was
wanted for various offenses. There be-
ing nothing for him to do except to
obey, he turned to o chalr on which he
bad left his.clothes and began putting

them on. He was so rattiéd that he did”

not for a few momedts fotice that the
clothes were not those be had taken off.
Phen be saw that the sult was the ex-
act counterpart Of the one worn by tho
man be had seen in the lounging room.

Gradually it came into his head that
this person had been hunted by the po-
Uce and, haying notieed the resem-
blance between himselfand MacKnight,
had conceived the Idea of throwing the
officers on a false scent. The supposed

criminal] could easily have learned the.

number of his room, opened the door
with ‘a skeleton key when all in tho
house were asleep, purloined Mac-
Knight’sclothes and left his own in
their place. rae

Holding up the suit he was ordered
to put on, MacKnight gave the police
men the abovo txplanation. They look-
ed at each other-as much as to say,
“Have wo been fooled?” Then, with-
out even consulting, they ordered Bac-
Knight to put on the clothes, first tak-
ing the precaution to go through the.

pockets, In which they found articles to”

  

(dentify the Owner with a prominent
criminal. The prisoner wos taken to a
police station and locked in a cell.

To be placed in such a poaition only
a few days before -his-expected wed:
ding was; to say tho least, distréasing.
MacKnight, who had: bad no erperi-
enco in ¢riminal law, did rot doubt

soon as given an opportunity.

corning you was left with us, you not

against’ you which we have seen print-
ed in the newspapers has seemed to

Circumstances stood in the way of

~ Leona, who had heard her lover ré-
