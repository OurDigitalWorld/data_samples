of the epidemic has passed.
Healey, son of ex-reeve Robert
Healey, is in a very serious condition
with pneumonia and pleurisy. His
father, who was in Northern Ontario
|hunting, has been recalled. Four
nrembers of the Adamson,family are
almost beyond hope; Bernard Malott
and wife are both down with the dis-
ease; James Black's family’ and Gor-
don Fox's family ‘are also sufferers,
Even the baseball match scheduled for
yesterday, (Thursday) was cancelled

ONTARIO, FRIDAY,

. WILSON SAYS. “SURRENDER.”

All doubts as to just what course
President Wilson might take with re-
gard to Germany's latest peace note
were set aside yesterday when his
reply was dispatched through the
| Swiss Minister. Briefly it said to the
| Kalser: “Surrender,” the matter of
}an armistice is up to the Allies, and
the terms of surrender are up to Gen-
leral Foch. This {s very satisfactory
to tie whole world outside the Cen-
tral Powera.

Sir Doughs Haig’s forces are driv-
Ing on at a terrific rate in Belgium,
both Valienclennes and Ghent having
fallen before his armies. The French
are also conquering ll before them.
Germany threatens’ to Oppose al) ad-
vances at the Rhine and* military
critics now fofecast that a drive on
Germiiny will follow from the east.
Turkey? and Austria are practically

down and out of the war

AMHERSTBURG LUCKY,
’

While there are a few scattering
cases of the “Flu” In Amherstburg,
some of.which are serious enough, so
far this town has been very lucky in
respect to the epidemic that Is having
such dread consequences throughout
tho country, and for this we as a
people should be truly thankful. Phy-
siclana are”hopeful that the crest of
the wave of sicknes® has passed and
that the disease has spent its force
eit is generally agreed, that (he "Flu”
is nothing more of, léss than old time
“grippe” that has invaded the coun-
try intermittently since 1889, each
epidemic having {ts own “peculiar
characteristics with fatal results. The
attack is complicated with pneumonia,
which accounts for so many fatalities.
If the people remain calm and follow
the precautions laid down by the
Provincial Boards of Health, good re-
sults are boand to follow.

VICTORY LOAN CAMPAIGN.
The Victory Loan campaign in this
district’ opens at Ambhorstburg next
Monday night with a monster mass
mecting In-the town hall, which opens
at 8.15 o'clock, The special speakers

Gregor and W. C. Kennedy, M. P., who

will be varied with, moving pictures
and musical numbers. People from
Amherstburg, Anderdon and Malden
should crowd the hal) that night. @
S. "Rutherford, member of the County
Executive, will be chairman. If there

the prevailing fMness, it will be held
in the open alr, game as the very suc-
cessful meeting of ®* similar nature

In the Days t
of Duellirg ;

Doles maine oceans nnatnehioa nian gt
T an election fr Queen's
County, between Gen. Walsh
and Mr. Warturton, of
| Garryhinch, boil’ the year
1783, took place the nost curious
{duel of any which tve occurred
within my recollection. A Mr, Frank
lshelton, a boisterous, Joking, fat
young fellow, was prevailed on,
|much against his grain to challenge
the exciseman of the ‘Own for run-
jning the butt-end of a horsewhip
|down his throat the night before,
whilst he “lay drunk and sleeping
with his mouth open
Frank, though he had been nearly
choked, was very reluctant to fight;
he said “he was sure to die if he did,
as the exciseman ould snuff a candle

with his pistol ball! and as he him-
self was as big as a hundred dozen
of candles, what chance could he
have?” We told him jocosely to.give
the excilseman no time (0 alm at him,
by which means he might perhaps hit
his adversary firat, and thus survive
the contest. He seemed somewhat
entouraged and consoled by the hint,
and most strictly did he adhere to it,

Hundreds of the townspeople went
to see the fight on theo green/of
Maryborough. The ground was réegu-

 

eo larly measured yn the fends uf

each party pitched a ragged tent on
the green, where whisky and salt
beef were consumed in abundance,
Skelton having taken his ground, and
at the same time two heavy drams
from a bottle his foster-brother had
brought, appeared quite stout until
he saw the balls entering the mouths
o& the exciseman’s pistols, which
shone as bright as silver, and were
nearly as long as fusils. This Vision
made a palpable alteration in Skel-
*ton’s sentiments; he chenged color,
and looked about him as if he wanted
some assistance: However, their se
conds, who wape of the same rank
and description, handed to each party
his case of pistols, and half-bellowed
to them: “Blaze gWway, boys!’

Skelton now recollected’ his in-
structions ani lost no time; he cock-
‘ed both’ his pistols at*once, and as
the exclseman) was deliberately and
most scientifically coming to his
“dead level,” af he called it, Skelton
let fly. 1

“Holloa!t” said the exclseman,
dropping his level, ‘I’m battered, by
Jasust”

“Tho devil’s cure to you!” sald
Skelton, instantly, firing his second
pisfol.

One of the exciseman’s legs then
gave way, and down he came on his
knee, exclaiming “‘Holloa! holla! you
bloodthirsty villain! do you want to
take my life?” n

“Why, to be sure I do!" said Skel-
“ton, ‘Ha! ha! have I stiffened you,
my Iad?”~ Wisely judging, however,
that if he stayed till the exciseman
Jrecoveréed his lega, he might have a
couple of shots to stand, he wheeled
about, took to his Heelsand got away
\as fast as possible.
| Jemmy Moffit, his own second, fol-
lowed, overtook, tripped up his heels,
and, cursing him for a disgraceful
rascal, asked, “Why he ran away
from the exciseman?”

“Ough, thunther!” said. Skelton,
with his chasest brogue, “how many
holes did fle ‘Villain want to haye
j drilled into his carcass? Would you
have me stop to make a riddle of
him, Jemmy?”

The second {haisted that Skelton
should return to the field to be shot
at. He resisted, affirming that he had
don@ all that honor required, ~The
second called him “a coward!”

“By my sowl," returned he, “my
\déar Jemmy Mofiit, may te so! You
call me a coward, if ycu please; but

I did it all for the best.”
“The best! you blackguard?” {

* “Yes,” sald?Frank; “sure, it’s bet-
ter to be a coward tham a corpse!
and I must’ have been either one or
t’other of them.”

However, he yas dragged up to
the ground.by Wis second; after
agreeing to fight agaia if:-he had an-
other pistol givenMiim. But, luckily
for Frank, thé list bullet had stuck
so fast between the bones of the ex-
eiseman’s leg that. hie could hot stand.
The friends of the Jatter then pro-
posed to strap him to a tree that he
might then be able to 8hoot Skelton;

but this being positively objected to
by Frank, the exciseman was carrica
home.—From Sir Jonah Barrington’s
Recollections.

WATER SUPPLIES FOR TOWNS AND CITIES.

SAFE WATER SUPPLY for a town or city: may be secured from
artesian wells, springs, Jakes, or streams, provided that certain’
well-defined rules regarding tbe source of supply are followed.
Artesian Wells usually give a safe supply unless the well {5 sunk

{n fissured rock which may provide a channel lable to carry pollution to
the well. If the well is sunk through clay, sand, or gravel, as is commonly

the case in this country, /the water will'as a rule be.of good quality, . Any
chance of contamination should be guarded against
ARTESIAN WELLS by having the s{des of thé pipe for_say four or five

feet from the top encased in conerete, the* top
sed against outside impuritiés and the sections of the pipe

securely clo
itself screwed together,

. bd ° e

Unless the area whence a apring drains is protested against surface:
pollution the’tpring {s not a very safe source of supply. In addition to the
general chances of pollution from thexsurface, the outflow of the spring
should’ be protected against-surfaco wash, At Niagara-on-the-Lake thore
{ ore some very good springs fin the embankment along the
SPRINGS Niagat, River. Before encampment of troops on an adjacent
comM}n the spring water {a on analysis practically pure. Within

a very short time ptter the coming of troops to the camp the’ water of the ‘
springs shoWS POllution and is unfit for domestic use, Some means of’
purification’ is nec: ssary for a supply from springa unless the drainage area
is securely protefiad against sewage pollution. i
° s e 1

_ It is @ POPjar idea that running water purifies itself and the
ordinary Obser¥e; seems to think that water passing over rapids or falls’
and exposed to ihe influence of air and sunlight rapidly loses any eowage
pollution it bas «cquired.. There is no truth in this,~ As an» example:

one Thay cite the condition of tho Nidgara River water which
STREAMS after roceiving the sewage of Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and other:

towns timbles over the falls and is whirled through the tur-
pbulént rapids loWsr down. As a matter of fact the water-of this river,;
despite all tb? 2¢ration and aunlight it bas received, is no better at tho
mouth of the rivex ¢han {t is above the falls, It is perhaps worse because all,
that the great falls and swirling rapids havo done for it is to mix the sowage
more thoroughly with the water. If tho same water were placed in.a reser-:
voir for thirty 3 {t would be greatly improved, for the reason that!
time kills the dijsase-producing bacteria, sedimentation of solids with tho
‘pacteria occurs. and sunlight and aeration have some good effect. Tho|
water of stream: jg good or bad according to the source and surroundings”
of the stream. 4 river coming from an‘uninhabited mountainous district}
is apt to be of fod quality. since it {8 not subject to contamination by the
- gewage of hums, poings, which Is, aftor all, the real dangerous form of,

If ates other band tho atream bas its origin in populous!
or through /

or if it flows through a district closely peopled)

a and villages which dump sewage over its banks, tho
water will very |\xely be unsafe for uso in its raw state. In-many in--
stances, howeVeT, sych water may be readily purified and made fit for une. |
Some streams 4t) turbid, that is thoy carry mud or sand in suspension; ’
-others, notably tiose having their origin in peaty swamps, are colored!
because of the diyoived organje matter thoy contain, Whilo these tmpuri-
ties make the WSbr unsightly, they/may not render it dangerous, Human
powage, let US Teat, is the d us ingredient of polluted*water. ~

WEALTH IN FISH OFFAT.

Average Trawler Could Enafr o Large
Amount.

The Empire Resources Devetop-
ment Committee, who are advocating
state development of the fisheries of,
the Empire on terms. that. would
bring fo the national exchequer a

& memorandum showing tho. pratits
that may be made from a more eare-
ful conservation of fish affal. A stam
trawler working in Icelandic. waters
frequently takes, on a three weeks’
voyage, from 70. to 90 tons of had-
dock, cod, plaice, coalfish, and the
like. The offal” taken therefrom
would amount to from 46 to 50 bar-
rels of livers alone, each barrel
weighing from five to six cwt. Under
present arrangements these are the
property of the crew, and are known
as stocker bait. The normal price
fetched is 32#*per barrel; now from
208 to 25s. The latest developments
include the splitting and curing of
he fish at sea, during a voyage
sometimes extending to eight weeks,
The livers are. separated and melted
to oll; all heads, bones and offal are
made into manure; 6ven the skins
have a commercial value, and not o
particle of the catch is wasted, The
amount of oil and manuro landed
from one trawleg {8 from 500 to 1,000
gallons of the former, and from 10
to 20 tons of the latter, while the
amount of salt fish landed is between
160 and 250 tons. The fish now
fetches from £30 to £45 per. ton,
agajnst £18 to £25, In. normal times.
A company has recently been formed
and a large plant erected for experi-
menting in the conversion’ of fish
skins and certain other kinds ofvoffal
into gelatine, glues and animal
foods,—Observer.

A Famous Scholar.

In the days when the author of
“Alice” was engaged with somo. of
the great scholars In Oxford In in-
venting a sham chargo of plaga
against himsdlf, a German orig
of the Jabberwock was suddenly dis-
covered, as well as renderings into
Greek and Latin. Tho effort wos
mado to get-Dean Scott to do tho
Greek translation, And “Lewis
roll” wrote to “My Dezr Dean,’ =
ing him to undertako ‘it. Scott, of
course, was one of the world’s great-
est Greek scholars, the, chief partner
in the production-of the famota,Tex!-
con, remarks tho Christlan Science
Monitor. Porson, indoed, has-been
described ais ‘a mero porson’’ com-
pared to him, and Johnson as having
no claim to the title of tho “Great
Lexicographer.” It was, in short; to
him that Mr Godley referred, in
some well known lines about anather

, famous scholar;

“He knew all that was to be, knova,
and much, too, ‘that was not—

He knew far more’Greek than Lid-

, wdell,but nothing like so much «3
| Scott.” , >

There was anothor great literary
co-partnership of the Liddell and
Scott day, in that of-Conybearo and
Howson, the atithors’ of the classic
Life of St. Paul. If Mr. “Godley
thought that Scott know more about
Greek than Liddell, a great Oxford
character, Murk Pattison, the rector
of Lincoln, was sure that Dean How-
son knew more about St. Paul than

been preaching in the chapel In Lin
coln, «After the services -Paitison,
strolling’ back Mthrough the quad-

by one of the fellows, who asked him
what he had been thinking of so pro-

‘R. L. S. Like Dickens.

Apropos of Dickens, there is 9 cur-
fous passage san the “Memories of
Vailima,” by Isobel Strong, bringing
©. D. and RN. L, S, into quaint con-
junction: “I have been reading ,a
paper by Miss Dickens, about her
father, and found oa particular in-
stante.in which Louls resembles him.
They both love dancing; but could

quite capable of getting out of bed
at night, like Dickens, to practice a

reminds me of-a story that Louis is
very fond of tdiling of an old French-
man in Samoa, who, the first time ho
gaw Louis, struck an attitude, and
exclaimed: ‘Ah? quello resembinnco!’
Then approaching him, ‘How like!
‘How like — Monsjour Charles Dick-

A CHAPLAIN DECORATED.

 

Elderly English Clergyman Who
Was Awarded tho ¥. C.

An English clergyman, over fifty,
who already holds the D.S.O. and
M.C,, has now. won the Victoria
Cross,

The Rev. Theodore Buyley Hardy,
Army Chaplaias’ Department, attach-

ed to tho Lincolnshire Reyiment, ‘s
the second cdergyman to win the
Wighest award for bravery during the
present war, and the third since the
Ve C. was fnstituted. Tho London
Gazette, announeing the award “for
Most eongspicuous braveryeand dovo-
tion to duty om many. occasions,”
says of. him: *

“Although over fifty years of age,
he has, by his fearlessness, dévotion
to men of his battalion, and quiet,
unobtrusive manner, won the respect

nd admiration of the whaje division.

narvellous energy and endur-

ance would be remarkable even-in a
very much younger man."

Several incidents exemplifying his
valor and devotion are quoted. An
Infantry patrol had gone out to at-
tack an enemy post in the ruins of a
village. The Rev. Hardy followed the
patrol, and about four hundred yarda
beyond our front line of posts found
an officer of the patrol dangerously
wounded. He remained -with . the
officer until hé was able to get assist-
ance to bring him in. There was a
great-deal of firing, and an enemy
patrol actually penetrated between
the spot at which the officer was ly-
ing and our front line and captured
three of our men.

On, another ogasion he worked
under shell and trench mortar fire,
digging out men buried by a ‘shell.
Once when our infantry had with-
drawn from a wood, and it was be-
lieved there was ho one left, Chap-
lain Hardy came out of it, and on
reaching an advanced post, asked for
help to gét in a wounded man.

Accompanied by a sergeant, he
mnde his way to the spot where the
man lay, within ten yards of.a pill-
box which had been captured‘in the
Morning, but was subsequently re-
captured and occupied by the enemy
The wounded man was too weak to
atand, but the chaplain and the ser-
Beant eventually succeeded in ge-
ting him to our lines.

Throughout the day .the enemy's
artilfery, machine-gun, ‘and trench
mortar fire was continyous; and
cuused many casualties,

NotwithManding, this very gallant
chaplain was seen moving quictly
wounded, absolutely regardices’ of
his personal safety.

Rev, T. B. Hardy ts viear of Hut-
ton Roof, Kirkby Lonsdale, West-
moreland. He was for sixteen years
master at Nottingham High School,
where he is remembered os a quict,
unassuming man. He took a keen
interest in gymnastics and all forms
of sport. While {in Nottingham he
held curacies in the city and dictrict,
and before necepting the living of
Kirkby Lonsdale he was headmaster
at Bentham Grammar School in the
West Riding of Yorkshire, Born ain
London he was educrted at City of
Tondon University. About ¢ightecn
montha ago’ ho was’ awarded tho
D.S.0. for bringing in the wounded
undor fire. Mr, Hardy's only son is
a captain Inthe R.A.M.C. while his
daughter sis serving with the Roa
Cross.

The only other army chaplain to
win “the V.C. inthe present war fs
the Rey, | EB...Nocl Mefliah,. who
brought in a mumber of wounded
under hiavy fire. This*award was
gazetted jn 1916. One other in-
stance of a clérgyman winning: the
honor {8 recorded—that of the Rey.
| J. W. Adams, who ofved sonie men
jof tho Sth’ )Lancors under fre in
Afghanistan in 1879.

 

 

 

Camouflage.

The oliserver in the airplane trios
jin vain to locate, tie enemy gun; his

eye, looking through a telescope, fails
to detect its muzzle through the fol-
jage. So he files away and tho gun
ia not attacked.

This j§ mn example of camouflage
as it fs practiced in the European
war. And the camoufinge in fo expert
that his business of fooling the en-
emy has become an art.

An early use of camouflage by the
| xenon was the application of paint
to bfg guns in srder to make them
{resemble the foliage in which they,
| were partly concealed. However,
When the guns hid to be placed in
; the open the disguise only,accentuat-
‘ed their visibility. Tho protective col-
oration of birds sn@ animals gave a
hint to the camoufiours who saw that
{t disguised the outlines of these
creatures and countoracted to a con-

‘aiderable degree thoir undernhadows.
So the high lights along the gun bar-.
irels were darkened and their under
surfaces Nghtened. The colors of the
paint, of course, barmonized with the
surrounding objets, The finishing

     
  
     
  
    
  

      
    

touches to this work consisted In ir)

which broke the Lutlines and at least
j confused tho observer if they did not
‘serve to produce ikvisibility. ~

NATIONAL FISH DAY.

It is the new national day which for

At present the annual value of Can-

about one-éighth of @ dallar a week

duatry and fish consumption haye not
kept pace with the general x Pan WT
of the country. A revival is long

is about one-half that of meat, so that
