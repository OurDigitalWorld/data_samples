OLD SANTA CLAUS

Is usually to be found in a Dry Goods Store. He has
P been coming every year regularly to this store for 56 years.
He always comes back, because he knows he gets good,
reliable merchandise here. .He simply carts away Hand-'
kerchiefs, and even in war_time he knows he is sure of
real Linen Table Cloths, Napkins and Towels and Towel-.
lings, notwithstanding the war has nearly driven such
articles out of the market altogether.

Then there are

Litile Dresses For Babies

And little girls, and big girls, too. Also Coats to keep
Jack Frost out, and nice Woolen Stockings, Underwear
and Stocking Caps, and Gloves, Braces, Belts, Hair Rib-
bons, and ever so many useful things that he thinks about
at the last minute, and he knows that if they are to be
found at all, there’s no place more likely that B., M. & G.'s
big store.

Commencing with Saturday, the store will be open eyen-
ings till Christmas.

Please note that we will remain open until 10 o’clock

Figures computed from ‘surveys

$2.12. The cost price was secured

labor cost per acre for wheat was

» A Christmas
Tree Idyl
2 or]

By ALVAH GORDAN GARTH

(Copyright, 1918, Western Newspaper Union.)

HE passenger conch was
filled with a merry
crowd and the Christ-
mas spirit was brond-
ly manifested. Luggage
racks were filled with
bundles giving out the
perfume of flowers;
here the head of a doll,
there the wheels of no
toy peeped out. Some
jovial traveling men
wére discussing their

welcome home and girls on college va-
ention bandied gny repartee. All wns
mirth and happiness—except with one,

Shrinking back into a dark corner
of the car was'a bronzed young man,
The face under the drooping gom-
brero bore a wistful,-anxlous expres-
sion. He went out to tke platform as
the train slowed up, leaped to the
ground, skirted the main treet,
evaded a brilliantly lighted church
where some Christmas eve festivity
was In progress and reached a house
set In the center of no large lot. He
gained the shadow of a grent ever-
Breen tree.

The forlorn lurker ventured a few
yards, gaining a view of an ell where
Tr dim i pieneteetyy,: TARO. CAT
forting sigh and something about “the
folks probably being at the church,”
adding: “I can watch. and walt. I
wonder if the old hideout in the tree Is
atill there?” He reached for a branch,
lifted himself aloft, scrambled up the
trunk and came to where on few boards
formed a platform. He had placed it
there when o boy. It trembled from
age as he crept upon it.

“Three years,” he whispered, dream-
Hy. “Christmas eve, home, sand—
what?”

He had left this selfsame spot a run-
away, he had returned like some fenr-
filled fugitive. How vividly he recalled
his Inst day. at home! He and others
had been playing ball next to the home
of wenlthy Judge Earll. A cheer had
greeted his strike which sent the
sphere whirling. It landed nguinst a

window, crashed through it and a min-
ute later ther® appeared o pale-faced,
excited servant, waving his arms wild-
ly and shouting out;

“Who did it? It has gone through
the judge's most valuable painting that
cost him two thousand dollars!" -

A wild thought come to Jasper. It
would ruin his father to pay that big-
two thousand dollars, Ah! he would
earn it himself, Longingly He glanced
at the vine-cluster@f cottage where
lived Edna Marsh, his first love, his
“girl.” Half an hour later he was
‘huddled tf a boxehr, going west.

Then three years, weary, tollsome,
with no word from home. He had been
lured to the gold diggings! Most days
he picked up flakes and nuggets worth
a dollar or more. Twice he was.lucky.
He lived at the cheapest rate. In his
snakeskin belt he stored the precious
dust. Theh, just before Christmas, the
call of home was not to be resisted.

With a shock he aroused, chilled nnd
confused. Lantern lights dazzled him
from below. He made out hnlf a dozen
forms. One was swinging an ax. It
sunk deep Into the base of the tree,

““Take turns!" called out a sten-
torian voice. “Let gjl hands haveya
clanee at cutting down the Biggest
Christmas tree {n town. How sho will
tower on the common tomorrow night,
all olive with colored electric globes
and gifts for the kids!”

“Hold on!” enlied down Jasper Wal-
den, missed a clutch ‘and fell to the
snowy ground. ‘

, He opened his eyes to find himself

lying on a couch in the house, his fa- |

ther, mother and sister bending over
him_with solicitous care and’ there,
clinging to his sister’s arm, pale and
anxious, was his boyhood Jove, pret-
tier than “ever—Edna Marsh.

“My boy; Oh, my boy, heaven fs.
kind!” cried his mother, *

Jasper unshipped the snakeskin belt.
“Father,” he said, “it’s full of gold. It
will,pay for Judge Earil’sstwo thou-
sand-dollar picture.” 4

“What! that sent you away?” cried

A tear-stained note had come to

five words: “It had to be—forglye.”
Revere had kissed Viola as his

By RALPH HAMILTON

(Copyright, 1018, Western Newspaper Unica.)

'T LACKED a week to
Christmas, but Ted
4 Newton, office boy for
Willis & Co,, had been
in holiday humor since
the first of the month
ond just now was
caught by the full in-
fluence of Yuletide.
His eyes sparkled as
he lifted various pack-
ages from a box that
had just arrived by cx-
press. Amid his chyckling and gloat-
ing smiles there came a check.

“What you got there, Ted?” sounded
sudden volce, and Ted turned to be
confronted by his “boss,”

“If you please, sir,” he stammered,
“It’s my regular Christmas box from
the folks home on the farm.”

“Let's see what you've gdt, Ted,”
suggested John Willis, and he fished

 

 

out a cake of maple sugar, bit off a
fragment and smacked his lips, _
ne™ stuff, “th?” ed
Jovially.

“You're a lucky lad, Ted,” spoke Mr.
Willis, his voic@ a trifle husky. Then
he went into his private office and for
ten minutes sat idly in his swivel chair,
a dreamy, far away expression upon
his face.

“T can taste that maple sugar yet!”
he sighed finally. “Let me see, it's
two years’ since I've visited the old
home town. I'm ashamed of it, for
we've run down to Nellie's folks only
twice since we were married. Maybe
she's longing for a sight of the coun-
try, too. Hello!”

He had picked up his mail,and be-
gan to riffle the elitted envélopes. The
first lines of the letter he opened read:

“My dear daughter Nellie: We are
so hopeful that you may give us a
Christmas visit this year, and you
and Mr. Willis would be so welcome!”

“Why, this won’t do!” ejaculated
John Willis, replacing ‘the letter that
had been carelessly opened by the of-
fice mall clerk., “Dear old people—and
Nellie!” @

His heart suddenly smote him.. Nel-
lie never murmured at the. exactions
of businéss;. Faithfully she accom-
panied him to social functions, and all
the time a conception of their hollow
superficiality had ended in o dream of
the dear old Hfe, where ‘true hearts
and quiet, humble pleasures seemed to
beckon longingly.

“Tm. going to take @ run down_ to
the country to look after my ‘old
home,” John Willis told Nellie that
evening. ‘The tenant has left and I
want to see-what can be done with it.”
He returned two days later, “Saw
your fdlks, dear,” lie gaid, and Nellie’s
famished soul greeted the tender word
like a cooling draught to o thirsting
spirit. “Look here, Tuesday is Christ-
mas eve. Those snowclad hills at
home, have made me-hufigry for a
sleigh ride. Be rendy to take a regu-
lar old-fashioned frolic.” And there
awoke in Nellie the GB extravagant
soul of hope.

* “Bundle up good,” directed her hus-
band the next. evening, as a double
team attached to a roomy cutter ar-

rived in front of the house.

“Now,
then, snuggle under those robes’ and;
let us see if. I haye forgotten how to

drive, Thirty miles—do you think
you can stand it?”

“Ob, John!" she almost eancedt
“That would be our homo town. You
don't mean—”

“That I am going to take you to
your folks? Yes, dear, and stay there
with you over the holidays. I say,”
bracing and thrilling is they started
down a clear smooth road full speed,
“this is like the old’times, when I, used

to steal a kiss from you, and— I'll
@ one now!”
She was crying for joy. Her trem-

bling hand stole to h{8 arm and lightly
rested there, Her heart was. singing
amid a newly awakened happiness,

. “The river, hill and old bridge!”
shouted John an hour Iater, alive with

enthusiasm. “Bonfire on the skating

patch and—whon! Nellie, this is my
Christmas present to you,’

He had halted in front of the old
Willis homestead, ptetentious in ita
mansioni{ke beauty. “I’ve decided to
give up the crowded city. Well, what
is it?”

She could not tell him at that su-
preme moment. ~% *

 
   
  
  
   
   
   
     
  
   
   
 

gay song of renewed youth and con-
tentment in a dash for Nellie’s old
home. She ran up the steps to greet
loving outstretched arms and fond
cries of heartsome welcome. :
“Home at last!” cried John Willis,
bursting into the brightly decdrated
parlor ‘Tadiant with” evergreen -and:
