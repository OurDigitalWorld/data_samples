Shortly after their marriage, Mr.

a strictly official year's “record * of

The Heifer freshened in pasture
on the 15th of October, 1917, at’ the
agé of 2 years, 7 month, 15 days,
She. was started on test on the 21at
of that month with the intention, of
making @ sev@n and thirfy-day “re-

her dally. prodwetion that it wag not }

until the week from Dec, 29 to Jan.

period 508.7 lbs, milk, 22.82 Ibs, but-

was during the period from Dec.”25.
to Jan. 24, when’ she produced
2,119.1 Ibs. mijk, 92.94 Ibs. butter.
It will be observed from these figures
that it was not \yntil the third month
after calving that she really got her
pace, and reached her maximum for
production, Her highest. day’s pro-
duction, on Jan. 2,-was 81.5 Ibs.

one of his greatest sorrows at leaving
Indiana was the fact that he could not
remain to cast his ballot for the Demo-

Cleveland and his friend.

All through the present war, Mr. and
Mrs. Strachan Have done their bit in
countless ways. Mra..Strachan made,
some time ago, a patchwork quilt,
which she donated to the Red Cross,
Since this quilt was given, it has been
sold and resold, bringing a~total: of
$450 to the organization. Mr. Strachan
owns a large amount of Liberty bonds
and Government securities, 7

it. has been a wonderful privilege,
Mr. Strachan says, to have «lived
through this great world war, and to

have been done during the past few
years. He considérs it a5 the greet-

BEING
‘CLEVER,

eucd
By HILDA MORRIS

(Copyright, ins, by the McClure Nawspa-
omy Der Syndicate.)

Emily was a very clever girl. Byory
one had always said so, from her ador-
{og aunt, who taught her the alphabet,
to her sociology professor in the uni-
versity. She was pretty, too, or rather,

, 48 her butterfly cousin, Kate, once re-
marked, “she would be stunning {f
she'd glve herself half a chance,” That
wns the trouble with Emily. In any
save intellectual directions she never
gave herself half a chance. She had

never felt the slightest tnterest in boys
and men except as tenchers and hu-
man belngs with worth-while minds,
At twenty-two Emily was that anom-

Ay among womankind, a girl who had
never had any sort of love affair.
True, there had been one or two young

men in her classes who would havo

liked to go farther than mere acquaint-

ance, but Emlly had never given them
| the slightest encouragement. “
When she went to visit Kate Inst
summer it was not because she wished
to share in the social. Hfe of which
Kate formed so enpricious a part, but
simply because she thought that Kate's
home {n a small town would be a good,
quiet place where she could work on
her theals undisturbed.
However, Emily was - mistaken.
There was not an evening when the
veranda was not filled with gay youth
come to pass the time, or there was not
a dance at the club, a party or a play.
The days were just as full; tennis,
“Soy rides” with one of Kate’s ridicu-
lous boys, picnics, teas—in short Emily
found that she would have to state her
} purpose in life quite flatly and ask
| Kate to count her out. So she sat in
| her room one afternoon, trying to con-°

centrate on-a thick volume with a for-
| midable title, while the sounds of gay
volces drifted up to her from the ve-
randa below.

_Kate was there, of course, and two
or three other girls. Also two young
men who should, thought Emily, have
been in better business. There was
something quite demoralizing about
the sound of their apparent pleasure.
Emily found {t hard to work. Not that
she envied them, rather she felt sorry
for them, poor frivolous things! She
closed her book and sat with her eyes
on space, thinking absently.

“Where's your cousin?” she heard
one of the men ask suddenly. 5)

“Emily? Oh, she’s boning over her
old books, at least she sald she was
going to.” (

“Poor thing!” commented another
girl. “I feel sorry for her. Just becnuse
she isn’t attractive and popular I sup-
pose she has to be intellectual. It
must be an awful strain!” ;

“J should say so," spoke up a third
girl. “I felt awfully sorry for her the
other night at that picnic. Everybody
else paired-off and had, a good time.
She looked awfully lonesome.”

“Well,” there was a_shrug In Kate's
voice. “I've done my best. I can't help
it if she isn't populure Besides, I think
she t lly Nkes to study. You ein’t
do anything for a girl ifire. that.”

Enily felt her face burn scarlet. So
they were sorry for her! Sorry for
her! Why, she had thought the pity
all. on her, own alde. Bow dared
they?

The voices below were rumbling on,

“They say Grant Sturgis is coming
home next week. I haven't seen him
for years, but they say he fs perfectly
stunning and an awful heart-smasher.
There's some onetto set your.onp for,
Kate, He has Toads and loads of
money.” \

It was right then, {n anger. and the
| spirit of revenge, that Emily concélved
) her remarkable plan. To think was to
| act with Emily, and she lost no time
in writing orders in to various city
stores. Within a few days mysterious
boxes began to arrive for her, tlie con-
tents of which she kept secret. If
Kate wondered about them it was
without a great deal of Interest. Books
no doubt, or some more of those-(m-
‘possible tailored skirts and flat-hetled
shoes that Emily siways wore.

There was to be an Informal dance
at the Countr;’ club one‘ evening a
week later. Rather to Kate's surprise,
Eimily said that she thought she should
like to go.

“Could you get n man for me?” she
asked her pretty cousin.

“Oh, yes, of course. There's Emmett
Brown; will te do? “I'm going ‘with
‘| Murray Jones myself, but when I get

there—!

just one man I want-to flirt with’ to-
night,.and ‘that’s Grant Sturgis. He's
the best looking and* richest man fh

Elmville,-and all the girls are wild |

about him. LI want tout them out.”

“You doubtless will,”.Emily encour-
aged her, with an off little smile.

Kate was so interested {n her own
dazzling toilet that she never stopped
to wonder what Smily might wear.
Indeed, she went off with her escort
before Emily was ready,,and did not
see her until after the second dance,
And when sie did see her she was’not

at all sure that it could be Emily.

“Who'd ‘that girl over there; the
stunning one in yellow with her ‘back
towards us?” she asked Emmett
| Brown, with whom she was dancing,

1 ‘Wall, fou ought tow know ;it's your

own tousdn., She looks mighty» nice | ¢

| tonight, #0.” “S ae.

daitity feet were safin-clad, ani she
danced divinely, More than that, she
was dancing with Grant Sturgis, andi
he appeared to be onjoying it!

As the evening slipped by, Kate
found that Emily danced very fre-
quently with Grant Sturgis. Indeed,
Kate herself had only one dance with
him, and his conversation during that
time was chiefly about her beautiful
eousin. Kate decided that he was not
so very handsome, after all, and if he
was queer enough to be fadcinated by
&@ blue-stocking ike Hmily— *

"Yes, she looks lovely tonight,” Kate
assented rather grudgingly. “I wish
she would do {t oftener, I hope #shé
hasn't bored you talking sociology.”

“Sociology?” he echoed in surprise.
“She hagn't, no. Does she—go in for
that? ¥ judged she was ao butterfly
kind of girl.”

And Kate was too amazed to an-
awer.

When Emily came home that night
she was o very radiant ond lovely
Emily. Kate was waiting for her, in no
very pleasant mood

“Well,” was Kate's greeting, “I hope
you had a good time, You got the lion
of the evening all right. Why didn't
you tell me you had that dress?”

Emily looked at her in mild sor
prise.

“It didn’t oecur to me,” she said.
“I'm sorry, Kate, if you mind because
I monopolized Mr, Sturgis. After what
you told me, perhaps it wasn't quite
fair. But you ste—

“What?”

“I happened to know that you all
thought I was an unnttractlve stick,
and I wanted to show you what I could
do.”

Kate's amazed look slowly widened
{nto an appreciative smile,

“Well,” she said, “I guess you show-
ed us. Every girl there was green
with envy.” ~

“And what's more,” Emily went on,
“I had an awfully good time. In fact
—Mr. Sturgis and I got so very well
acquainted that—I shouldn't wonder
bat what I may decide to marry him,
os he wants me to,”

“Oh, Emily!” murmured Kate, “I
always knew you were clever, but
this—. My, I guess clever people can
do just about anything they want to,
can't. they?”

BUILDS CHARACTER OF CHILD

Kindergarten One of the Most Valuanle
Features In the Scheme of
Education.

Kindergarten methods, whether be-
gun by the mother fn her own home or
by the trained teacher in school, are
of inestimable value to the child, for
character bullding ts always made their
principal aim and object.

Perhaps mothers may not haye been
trained in kindergarten methods, but
at lenst they can learn how to tell a
story. Anyone can read a story, but
telling one is much more effective and
much more enjoyable to the child, Wv-
ery mother shouldslearn how to tell
a Story. Use your,own words and
choose simple and forceful ones.- A
bare plot is Interesting to the tiny
child, but many details should je sup-
plied for the oldér boy and girl: they
‘love them. Use direct discouwse when
possible. Be enthnalistic. Be dra-
matie; Aftemthe story is finished, talk
{t over freely wih the children. Choose
some storfes yhitch teach kindness to
‘animals anf some which give training
in morale or-good habits, but never
point the moral.

A tast for best literature an often
be formed in early childhood through
o wise cinice of stories, This is also
true of music. The songs and music
used in the kindergarten are always
carefully selected by the kindergartner
and should be jist as carefully selected
for the home by nother. Allow your
children to hear only the best.

Besides story telliug and music, there
are also pictures. Thoge which inter-
pest2the child must show action and
‘Movement. Pitures are -helpful be-
cause they develq the Imagination and
arouse the creative faculties; *

Games also aid in the great work of
character bullding. “They help to de
velop ‘self-expression and originality
and can also be used to teach sélf-help-

fulness toward others, Through games |

children may be made to discover the
evil effects of ‘self-will and the good
resulting from self-control.

Play a story. with your child. ‘Sed

how attemtive he willbe and what

powers of self-expression he possesses.

To Solve Canada’s Employment Problem

VERYONE in Canada should understand just what

the Government is doing to solve the unemployment
problems that may arise through tHe demobilization of

our fighting forces.

(1) Employment Offices.

So, that everyone—male or
female, soldier or civitian—can
get quickly such jobs as are
available the Ghyernment js co-
operating with the Provineées in
establishing a chain of Public
Employment Offices. Employ-
ers are being urged /toynake tse
of these offices to. secure’ any
help they néed. Farmers, for
example; who wW@ed hired. men
should: apply %© the nearest
office. There will be a> Public
Employment. Office in evajy
town of 10,000 people “and
“wherever the need for one exists,
There will be 69 different ofices
i all—ohe-half are already jn
operafion. :

 

(2) Employment Opportunities

Hon. Charles Murphy a plan which’
the latter had prepared for lighten-

on account of its proximity « to
his ‘home he felt it was worth
more to him.” “Now what price would
be the actual yalue of the *farms?”
asked the speaker. In usban munici-
palities the task of the assessor ,{s
even more difficult. A house costing
$5,000 to build In one section of a city
would readily rent or seliefor more
than a similarly constructed house in
another part of the city. Should both
the-houses be assessed at the same
j valuation? FPve years ago it cost leas
to build a house than it does to-day. The
| price of building matérial has gone up
and consequently the value of the
house built in pre-war days also bas
gonesup. Would it have been fair to
increase the taxation on that house,|
because the value of materials during
abnormal times have soared? 1 think
not, To my mind there is no ‘basis
from which an assessor can arrive at
the actual value of rural lands, dwell-
ing houses and business places; there
an’ official entrusted to assess
property for taxation must use his
own judgment” Regarding the col-
lector’s roll, Mr. Coyle favored the
system of arranging the lats cansecu-
tively in each concession so that any
lot can be located without searching
the whole roll. Blue prints prepared
by the engineer, showing the number
of names of owners, acreage and num-
bers would be useful to council mem-
bers and officials. Several members
expressed their wievys upon the mat-
ter dealt with in the paper, and were
of the opinion recommendations should
be made to the Ontarlo Municipal As-
sociation. This met with general
favor, and the motion to deal with the
