Out loud he sald, “Sure thing.”

“Ob, and there’s one thing more—
about thd bool: You'll attend to any

suffer because its nuthor happens to

city desk of the Post young Weir's
| white face kept coming between La-
tham and bfs work. He bad half a
mind to write to the girl himself, Still,
| Be had’ made it the rule of his life to
| mind his own business.
| “Afterward, on a sudden impulse, he
eat down and wrote a letter to the
young woman who hadn't sense enough
to appreciate Jimmie Weir. “He told
| very simply and lucidly-the story of
how Weir had thrown himself in front
| ef a cable car to snve a child and in
| go doing had lost his hand, how the
boy's first; words after recovering! con-
sciousness had been.as to the safety
of the child and how the young author
lay in the hospital at the point of
| @eath. Then he told graphically of
ithe young man’s fight against {ll health
and poverty, of the brightness and
good. cheer which never deserted bin
and which won all men to him. “He's
the most charming man the Lord ever
left unmarried. I don't know whether

Latbam's mind an idea for booming
“The Dice of the Gods” that he always

walked down to the depot to meet a
young woman from Buffalo,

A pray eyed girl in a brown travel

fore the porter bad well settled the
btool.

“How 18 he?” she demanded from
Latham before the newspaper MAD ad
announced himself, Her quick eye had
piéked him out at once. x

“Better; he has a chance,” answered
Latham. “This way for the cab,
please.”

Latbam could nob tell on the fourney
to the héspital whether she cared for
Weir or not. She was 60 quiet and self
composed, 80 eminently mistress of
herself, that he felt an unworthy de-
sire to say something that would cut
ber to the quick, But once, when they
got caught jn jam of carriages and
had to wait a few moments, she turned
a white face to him and asked if there
} were not some way of getting to the
| hospital faster. Then Latham wanted
to shake hands with himself for hav-
ing sent for ber. -

The city editor made a pretense of
talking with the nurse a moment while
Miss Sheldon went into the room alone,

“You poor boy!” hg heard her cry
with indescribable tenderness, ‘

When Latham, after yebement cough-
fhg, pushed into the room, he found
ber kneeling by the pedaide crying soft-
ly over the bandaged stump. As for
Jimmie Weir, it took no specialist to
tell that the young man had taken &
renewed grip on life.

Arab Dancing Girls.

An English traveler thus describes
the Arab dancing girla he enw at a
fair at Biskra, in the Sabara: “Here,
surrounded by a rope, on raised deal
benches, sit the dancing girls. Beneath
them.{s a. deal table’ covered with
strange sweetmeats and sirups. Oppo
gite to them is a bench, upon whida,
after a small payment, you may install
yourself and admire Zora, Fatima, Ai-
chouch or Algin at your ease. They
nre worth seeing in their gala attire.
Indeed, they look like a troupe of mag-
nificent, chattering macaws perch
{n the sum. Some, the rea] Ouleds,
wear crowns of gold, surmounted by
tufts of tinted ostrich. feathers. Upon
their painted fingers. are heavy bat
Daric rings. ~Upon their arms are
massive gold and silver bracelets. Veils
of gold and silver tissue float around
them, half concealing their robes of
pink, yellow, magenta, scarlet and
bright green silk. One wears a broad
band of: dinmonds across her broad
forehead. Another bas sewed her enr
rings upon strips of velvet and is lit-
erally clid-in gold coins, whiich make
the eyes of the Arabs glitter greedily.
A third, th wonderful Gazela, can
scarcely move to the sweetment table
to drink a glass of sirup with an ebon
admirer, so londed 18 sho with neck-
laces, amulets and ankle rings.”

‘Including a New Remedy.

The bran or mash mixture is prob;
ably used more than ony othor meth-
od, It 16 made by uping 50 pounds of
bran or dn inferior grade of flour to)
one pound of Paris green. The mix-
ture {8 then mojstened with 2 gallons
of water, and sweetened with one gal-
lon of molasses. It should then be
thoroughly mixed. After mixing well
the poison bait fs Teady for the cut-
worm, On one to’two days prévious
to planting a fleld of tobacco this
piixture should be sown brovdeast late
in the afternoon or in the evening, It
is very destructive to the cutworms
if properly mixed, and is effective till
it becomes very dry or till a rain
comes. ‘

Another method consista In dipping
green bits of clover, cabbage, or any
green tender stuff In a solution made
by using one pound of Paris green to
50 gallons of water, and acattéring the
green material thus treated ct inter-
vals of @ few feet late in tho evening.
This method involves too much labor
to be used on a large scale, but it is
very effective.

During the past season a mixture
of arsenate of Jead, in the paste form,
in the, proportion of 1 pound of the
paste to 7 gallons of watcr was used
to control the cutworms, The plants
were pulled from the bed at trans-
planting time, dipped roots and all in-
to the solution, and thon set in the
field, When they dricd off a good
white coating covered the plant. The
growth of the plant was good, and no
damege was done to tlre foliage with
this strength solution. The orsenate
of lead adhered to the lent ond stem
of the young plant well, not belng
easily washed off by rain.

This method gave excellent results
Jast year. Very-few plants thet had
been treated were attacked by the
ecutwormsa, but where no treatment
was given to the plants the cutworms
did a great deal of damage. The main
disadvantage of the method is that as
the plants are dipped the soll adher-
ing to their roots comes off in the
solution and makes {t very dirty: The
plants should also be set very soon
after dipping. 5

The difficulty of the solution bécom- };
ing so dirty,as to meke it unfit for
use can be largely overcome by mak-
ing a kind of cotton cloth basket or
putting cotton on the inside of an or-
dinary basket and dipping basket ond
all jnto the solution. Very Iittlertime
would then re required for dipping
the plants.

Ancther way, of applying the solu-
tion. would be to épray it onto the
plants, with a knapsack sprayor just
after they are set, A large quantity
of solution would be required because
it would be necéssary to apply. it
heavy enough to cause some of the
liquid. to rum down the stem of the
plant, lenving it white on drying.

This method has been tried for only
one year, butrthe results seem to jus-
tify its being given a, trial by anyone
who hns had tobacco attacked. by
cutworms or fears an rttack this
spring. The cost should be compar-
atively small for dippixge enough plants
for several acres.

CORN EXPERT !S AT BOUSTED
f

The appointment-of P) L. Fancher,
as e@orn expert for Ontario ins been
announced. Mr. Fancher ig a mem-
ter of this yenr’s graduating class at
the O: A. Cy and hails from Lambton
county.

In announcing the pending appoint-
ment at the Gorn Show last winter,
Dr. G. C. Creelman stated that the
specialist, would devote his time to
the standardization and developmant
Of seed corn strains (along the line
that Dr. Zayitz works’ with - other
grains at Guelph), and that he would
probably have a close conneétion with
the Corn Show.

Speculation. was rife as to who
would receive the appointment, there
beingeyminy ‘different opinions as to
who was properly qualified. to carry
on this expert work. Dr. Creelman
had explained that it was impossible
todo good Work at Guelph, where soi}
and weather conditions were Jess. fav-
orable than in the “Corn Belt,” and for
this purpose the work would ‘have to
be carried on apart from the O, A. C:
It was thought that a man already in
touch with the seed corn
would receive ‘the appointment, who-
ever it might be.

Mr./’Fancher will come to the work
with an open mind, and will be able
to make out of the position just what
he wills. If he ‘has the capacity and
tact necessary: for the work, much
may be done for the corn industry;
if not, it may-turn out to be “Just an-
other Government job,”

At tHe time of the Corn Show, the
announcement of the. pending ap-
pointment of an expert was enthus-
jastically .received, and nothing but
favorable comment was heard. This
speiks well for Mr. Fancher’s recep-
tion, and The Sun joins in the hope
that it spells happier days for the Corn
Show and the seed corn industry.—

SOUTHERN. POTATOES
CAN BE USED IN NORTH
FOR SEED PURPOSES

Since smal)-sized new potatoes from
southern.states are Jower in_price than
old’ stock in_the North, many growers
will be-induced to plant them, but jn-
less handled soms to hasten germina-
tion results will be disappointing, say
gardeners at the.Ohlo Agricultural Ex-
periment Station. Such seed planted
1 under usual conditions will not grow

for many weeks and then irregularly.

Greening the tubers in: partial sun-
light for at least two weeks; or placing
them in cold storage for the same
length of time, brings about the ripen-
ing necessary’ for germination. <A
quick method {s ‘to rub off.the skin of
the new potatoes and then to plant
them immediately. They will sprout
as soon os old potatoes, but there is
especially dn. wet
seasons, Cutting the tuberp in pieces
of medium size has the same effect.
| ~ New potatoes with white skins ore
| mostly the Irish Cobbler, and those
| with pink skins the Triumph variety.’

Both’ varieties have been.found by the

‘Experiment Station satisfactory for

Need the Rich, Red Blood Dr.

Williams’ Pink: Pills Actu-
ally Make,

Thin-blooded people do not remain
so from choice but from indifference,
in some cases from despair. People
who are pale, languid, with palpitation
of the heart, some difficulty in breath:
ing and a tendency to be easily tired
are suffering from thin blood. They
need only the resolution to take the
right treatment and stick to ft until
cured. ‘The remedy that can be relied
upon {a Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, With every dose they
make new blood, and new blood means
health and strength. The red cheeks,
good appetite, increased weight and
atrangth that follow the tse of these
pilld prove their great value to thin-
blooded people, Here is an exampleé;
Mrs. J. McDonald, jr., Hay, Ont., says;
“| honestly believe Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills saved my life. Some years ago
I had anaemia, and as I did not realize
the seriousness of the trouble T soon
became a complete wreck. I got 80
weak I could hardly walk. I neither
ate nor slept well, and could not. go
up stairs without stopping to rest. At
times L had av almost unbearable pain
in my back and would have to remnin
in bed. I suffered almost constantly
from a dull headache, and when sweep-
ing. or I would stoop to pick up any-
things would get so dizzy that I would
have to’ catch hold-of something to
keep from falling. At times my heart
would beat so fast that I would have
a smothering sensation. My eyes
were sunken and my hands and-limbs
would be swollen in the mornings, I
tried several kinds of medicine without
benefit and my friends thought I would
not recover, Then I began taking Dr.
Williams”:Pink Pills, and before long
could sea.ant {cel that they were ‘relp-
ing me. I gladly continued the use of
the *pills until Mwas completely cured
and i cannot say enough in their
praise, and a strongly recommend them
to all run down girls anil women.’

WORKING WOME!
Some Have to Keep on Until

They Almost Drop. How
Mrs. Conley Got Help.

Here isa letter ne & woman who

had to work, but was too weak and suf-
fered too much to continue. How she
regained health ;—
Frankfort, Ky.—‘‘I suffered so much
with female wenn ee that I could not
lo my own work,
qe had to hire it done.
I heard so much
about Lydia E. Pink-
bam’s Vegetable
Compound that I
triedit. I took three
bottles and I found
it to -be all you
claim. Now I feel as
well as ever! did and
i} am able to do all my
————"own work again. I
recommend it to any woman suffering
from female weakness, You may pub-
lish my letter if you wish. ’’—Mrs, JAMES
CoNLEY, 616 St. Clair St. Frankfort, Ky.
No woman suffering from any form of
female troubles should lose hope until
she has given Lydia E. Pinkham’s Veg-
etable Compound a fair trial. :
This famous remedy, the medicinal
ingredients of which are derived from
native, roots and herbs, has’ for forty
years proved to bea most valuable tonic
and invigorator of the female organism.

All women are inyited to write
to the Lydia E, Pinkham Medi-
cine Co., Lynn, Mass., for special
advice,—it will be confidential.

BOATS TRAVEL LAKES

The tremendous growth of traffic on
the Inkes with the pnst four years
makes it.necessary for boats to pass
one another with tho regularity of

ANNUAL. REPORT OF
EXPERIMENTAL FARMS

An interesting statemen: appears in,
the first volume of.tle report of the
director of Government Experimental
Farms, whieh denis with the cost of
growing certain crops, as follows:—
Mangels, $1.55 a ton; ensilage corn,
$1.45 ton; onts, 12:39 cents a bush-
el, ind hay, $5 a ton. The system of
farming represented in these experi-
ments is explained in the report. It
is also shown as a result of seven
yetrs’ experiments that in- fertilizing
the soil a distinct advantage is shown
in the use of barnyard manure aloe,
over commercial,fertilizer alone, The
experiments suggest the poxsibility
of combining the two profitably when
barnyard manure is» scarce or high-
priced. Referring to néw strains of
grain being produced it is stited that
hull-léss and beardless barleys are re-
colying close attention with the
promise of some exceptional results.
Earlier*’and more productive varieties
are being soug ht for, while, new
strains of oats, peas, beans, buckwheat
and flax are being tested. Those are
but @xamples of the character of the
information contained in the 598
pages of this first volume that can be
received, without cost, on application’
to tlie Publications Branch of the De-
partment of Agriculture at Ottawa.

UNAWAY ON
THE A. AND B.

By JAMES EDMUND DUNNING.....

The G, P. A. put his hend into the

general superintendent's doorway and
sald;

“Old Tympan'’s out there agafn, I
see, Palmer.”

“No use,” replied the general super-
intendent. “His name came in two
hours ago. I told him to report here
next time he got drunk. This finishes
him.”

Five minutes Inter old Tympan, aft-
er forty years of service for the A. and
B,, went tumbling down the staira be
cause he was drunk at the Hancock
street switch the day the directors
went up the line. Palmer had- given
him a pass home, eighty miles up the
road, and then fired him with ten of
the words Palmer wasn't accustomed
to using on ordinary jobs.

Train No. § pulled in while Tympan
fumbled the pass on the platform, and
he climbed in and found a double seat
In the smoker, He knew only that he
was out of a job, with a full pint in
his coat and Palmer's transportation
to take him up home, where he could
camp down for the winter with the
boya. He had threatened that many
times, They deserved it for letting
bim work for a living.

“Taking vacation, Tympan?” asked
Hennessy of No. 8 when he came
through for tickets. Tympan admitted
he was off for o bit of time up tho
road.

“Guess you ain't coming back right
off,” taunted Hennessy. “The return
check on your pass don’t seem to be in
sight. Long Jay off, ch, Tympan?!”

Tympan sat up, pulling Nis hat over
hia eyes,

“Dick Hennessy,” he enld, “you go
slow on yer kiddin’ 'r I'll ronst you one
o' these days f'r beln’sopmart. They've
fired me, you c’n bet—yes,-they have;
fired me good, but I’m next to Palmer
yet. An’ I heard what.Palmer told
the G. P. A. this mornin’ about your
runnin’ over orders.twice last week. I
know, somethin’, an’ don't you kid me
no more!”

Train No, 8’s conductor ignored the
challenge, partly because he dared do
no more. He knew the whole operat-
ng department bad been knocking ev-
erybody in sight because old Tympan,
invariably drunk and disorderly, held
his job while better and younger and
sober men were overhauled in Palmer's
office-for nothing more than leaving
stations half a minute ahead of or-
ders or failing to vise the annual of
some of the spying directors who went
up and down. R, H. Palmer got a
master tongue lashing those days from
the rank and file, and now that. the
dismissal had really come Hennessy
Was no more skeptical than any of tho
others ¢oncerning the general siperin-
tendent’s honest intention of keeping
Tympnn out of Bérvice.

Hennessy tried to conciliate Tympan
on his next trip through, but the old
man lay with his hat over his face,
steaming with rage, too angry even to
curse. No. 8 was mnaking beautiful
work, and Hennessy felt better than
usual. He had eight cars with a big
lond-of women and kids and. wanted to
be on time anyway because it was hie
Iny off that Saturday and there was an
all night game In the “club” at home,

At Inchburg Hennessy got his usual
orders, everything all straight, and left
ontime. Therear brakeman found him
just afterward ind sald?

“Hear about the wild freight went
up ahead of us? She's a big one, and
{t wouldn't surprise me if she got
atuck on the Long Misery and held us
at Lysbon.” }

Hennessy knew his man was right
Lyshon station is at the foot of a
thirteen mile grade known for good,
reasons as f*the Long Misery.” If a
frelght-got hung there ahead of,No. 8,
it meant everything balled up, for the
A. and B. iy 0 single line, and the dl-
rectors won't stand for. a: siding .be-
tween Lyshon and. Oldtown, the sta-
tion at the crest of the Long Misery.

Hennessy took the platform at Ly-
shon before No. 8's brakes held her dnd
sought the dispatcher in the dingy sta-
tion. ~

“Wild freight?” echoed tho telegra-
pher. “Yes/ vent up on hour ago. Big
train? Yes, big train, but sho’s got a
good rall, and I don't believe she'll
shold you a minute” |

Hennessy went out and looked in the *
book by the’ station. door. He found
Where the wild freight had reported
and saw. with satisfaction that she was
in charge of Bitters, ono of the ‘ring
and sure to do his best to get that
heavy train out of the way long before
Hennessy came along,

Lyshom was on the card for only
thirty seconds, but Hennessy risked a*
trifilng delay and wont back to the op-
erator:

“Can't you ask Oldtown, just for a
chance, if that freight’s’ showed up

the fugitive qecilon was slowly moving
off, very slowly, down the-héad end of
the Long Misers:

“Back up, trpht Back up and eateh,

“You can't do it!” yelled a brenthiess
brakeman who ¢ame up from the rear,
“because the gears Just completely out
oO’ the head o’ that section and there
wouldn’t be nothin’ to make a couplin’

Bitters was thinking of Hennessy
and No. 8 If No.8 were on time, she
was just leaying Lyshon. Chances
were she was Ini@. He knew Hennes-
sy. It was for him to reach Oldtown
in time to stop Nu. 8 at Lyshon. Bit-

ters sickened at the thought of the.

Saturday night rush of women and
children which had given Hennessy’s
train th® namo of the “nursery ex-
press.”

They worked quickly then. In thirty,
secondg Bitters was in the cab, and his
Trish engineer was giving the mogul
steam enough and some to carry. Bit-
tera figured {t was four miles to tho
gonl; and the way they paced it off
mado it Impossible for him to say he
was disappointed when he jumped off
at Oldtown.

“No, 8, hold her at.Lyshon. My
freight’s bu'sted, an’ thirty-three of
‘em aro on tho grade, goin’ to beat
thunder!”

“No. 81” The dispatcher’s face was
pie crust. “She left Lyshon six min-
utes ago, late.” He went back to his
{natrument and sent “Seventeen,” the
clear out signal, to warn the road
south of htm, but.as he did so he knew
that No, § was coming up Long Misory
ten minutes late, straight into the
teeth of the worst runaway the A. and
B. had known.

e se s e

Henheasy was fuming at Lyshon,
for he couldn't afford’ another second,
yet Oldtown had seen nothing of the
wild freight.

“Better walt for another report. from
Oldtown,” said the operator. But
Hennessy was six minutes late then
and resolved to go on up-the grade.
He signaled his engineer and jumped
on the rear. The brakeman was thero
and grinned when the conductor cursed
hia luck.

Hennessy, tialf way through the
door, wheeled. There, away back by
the station platform, only a fading bit
of dismal detail in the familiar view,
was old Tympnn standing in the mid-
dle of the track and waving crossed
arms.

“Left and signaling us to come back
for him,” said the rear brakeman.

Hennessy spoke eloquently, looking
ot hig watch. The time frightened
him. “I'll not go back forshim,” ho
cried. “I can't be’—

There was that in the rear brake
man’s cyes which stopped Hennessy.
Suppose he should leave Tympan at
Lyshon over Sunday, with no: trains
elther way, and suppose the old man's
pull with R.H. P. were still working,
and suppose the young husband of her
who was Nell Tympan, he who worked
in the G. P. A’s office, shduld—

And there was old Tympan himself
standing in the middle of tho track
and signaling, “Back up, back up,
back up.” Could he afford to ignoré
the old fellow? Though it hurt him to
do it, he said:

“No, Lsbelleve I'll go back for the
old guy, Bill.”

The rear brakeman pulled tho cord,
and Hennessy went in. to-reckon just

e ° s

how much over thirty minutes late,

he would be into Oldtown.

There was no denying that old Tym-

pan was exceeding drunk. Hennessy
amothered his wrath with difficulty as
No. 8 backed into Lyshon, for. he
hadn't relished what he had ‘heard go-
ing ‘through the day coaches: He leaned
out toward the dirty figuro reeling
across the platform and heard Tym-
pan’s idiotic laugh as he boasted of
baying called back the biggest train
on the road. “I jus’ went out there—
ri’ out there—and elgnaled, “Back up,’
and yér backed up, didn’ yer? I tell
yer, gents, there ain't er man o’ the
ro’d darst ter dis-disobey my orders.”

There was a scramble on tho plat-
form.behind them, and.the dispatcher
came shrieking like a plow train at a
blind crossing,

“Back up, Hennessyffor all you're

worth!” he shouted. “Runaway freight
(—thirty something cars off the wild

train coming down the grade—be here
in less than a minute. Oldtown wired.
Qh,’ Hennessy, look up the line!”

It was a cloud of sand.and dust at
(tho first curve in the Long Misery,
three miles away.

Hennessy’s knees wavered. The dis-
}patcher struck’ him with his fist be-
tween the shoulders, crying: “Quick,
man! Run her back into the siding and
let tho freight go by.”

Tho- passengers knew only enough
to complain that they were horribly
shaken up that afternoon near Lyshon,
It was Hennessy himself who switched
No. 8 into the siding and who thanked:
