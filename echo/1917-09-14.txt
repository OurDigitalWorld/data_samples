BADLY

Oswald Knister Accidentally Shot; i¢
Taken to Chatham Hospital.

INJURED

 

Oswald Knister, of Ruscomb, is in a
grave condition in the Public General
hospital {in Chatham as the result of
an accident Saturday.

Mr. Knister had been spending the
holidays with his mother-in-law, Mra.
Hellick, on Lake St.. Clair, near Ston-
ey Point, and had a gun with him. He
had-loaned it to a fisherman, who had
réturned-it, and just as the latter had
handed’ it to him, he was swinging it
and the trigger caught saymething and
the gun exploded.

One of the fingers of the left hand
was shattered amd the charges then
went into the jeff side of Knister’s
face, mangling the face and passing
upwards as far as the~base of the
skull, fracturing it and exposing his
brain. He was brought in about mid-
night to the hospital

Dr, McColl, of Tilbury; Dr. Duncan,
and Dr. McKeough, of Chatham, per-
formed an operation and dressed the
wounds, Mr. Kmister has a wife and
two children, amd is very highly re-
spected.

TWO DELICIOUS RECIPES,

 

: —— .&

“Farmer's Wife,” writing, saya: “I
send two recipes which may prove
helpful to some One.” They are for
rice pudding and a novel type of ap-
ple jelly.

For the first the writer says:

“When making rice pudding, equal
parts milk and water will make it as
good as whole milk. My recipe for
years*has been: One cup of rice, two
cups of milk,/and 2 cups of water,
one egg, sugar, salt and spice to taste.
Mix all together, an@. bake In oven
from one to one ahd a holt houra;
stirring two or three times.”

Of the second, she gays:

“For some years | haye gathered
all apples that fell in @ small arch-
ard and made jelly. I haye boiled six
or seven different kigds together, and
night, through
cheese cloth. In the morning I meas-
ure juice and allow one pound sugar
(heated) to a pint of juice, after it
has boiled twenty Minutes. As the ap-
ples ripen, I lesg@h sugar to about
three-quarters pound toa pint of
juice. You will find this jelly is firm
and, tastes 85 £6o0d as when: made
from one kind. ‘The ‘drop’ is only
from two trees this year, and I have,
made twenty pints Already.”

HOSTESS

She Entertained a Great
Man Unawares

  
  

By F. A. MITCHEL

“Gindys,” sald Jobn Oldershaw to
fis daughter before setting out from
the family realdence in tho province of
Ontario, Canada, “General Herbert is
eoming to see me this morning by ap-
polntment to talk over military mat-
ters pertaining to our Canadian part
fn the great war. I have been sum-
moned to another conference of equal
importance. I must rely upon you to
keep the genera) engaged until my
return, We have important matters
to talk over, and I don’t wish him to
leave wifhout our having the con-

ference.”

“What kind of matters?”

“Herber® las been fighting in Bel-
gium and has greatly distinguished
himself. i need the information he fs
able to impart. While recovering from
a wound lie has been sent over here
to instruct us in the needs and neces-
sities of the Canadian troops at tho
front.”

“How jong will you be gone, papa?”

“It_may be an hour; it may be all
day.”

“Well, papa, I'll do what I can with
him, but I don’t. see how I, a mere
gir), can entertain a general.”

The last few words were not heard
by the farther, who was hurrying away
to catch a train. «

Gladys Oldershaw proceeded to ex-
ecute certain; household duties which
devolved upon her as her father’s
houselkeeper. They were not onerous,
and diid not take up much of her time.
When she had finished them ghe went
out.om to the porch and looked about
her for some’ out of door occupation or
amusement. The croquet ground look-
ed inwiting, and, taking out @ box of
balls amd a mallet, she went there and
began to play alone. But sho found
playing: croquet without an opponent a
very ‘unsatisfactory amusement, and
was, ubout to give it up when, looking
asidic, she saw a small, slender young
man whose clothes fitted him badly
looking over the fenco at her.

“Beg pardon,” he said. “Is this Mr:
Oldershaw's place?”

“Wt ig.”

“Is be at home?”

“No, he has gone to the city.”

The young man looked disappointed.
He asked how long Mr. Oldershaw
would remain away.

“Father expects a man to see him
today, a general who has come back
from the war. - Father told me before
going to tell this man that he might
be gono an hour and he might be gono
al) day.”

A curious expression passed over tho
stranger's face at the mention of the
great man who was expected.

“I don't know,” he said, “that Mr.
Oldershaw will have any-time to devote
to me, haying the general with him.”

Gladys made no reply to this; sho
evidently thought the man was quite
right.

“What ies your idea of a general's
age?” he asked.

Gladys considered the question irre-
leyant but concluded to answer it. She
eafd a general must be an old man;
forty at Teast. *s

“TY think I'll wait avhile,” said the
little man, Jooking interestedly at the
nearby tennis court.

“You might put in some time at ten-
nis,” suggested Gladys; “that is, if you
play the game.”

“One “can't very well play tennis
without an opponent,” was tho reply.

Gladys told hinr that she was disen-
gaged and would accommodate him.
She procured a racket for him, and,
climbing the fence, he took position for
the game. He appeared to be an ex-
pert player, but was at a disadvantige
in getting over the ground, dragging
one leg after him with somo slight dif-
ficulty. .

Tdey played several sets, and durin:
the time occupied in doing so Gladys’
opinion of her opponent was being im-

proved..He seemed to be rather gentle |

for aman, but amiable as well, and’ ho
was quite original ip his way of eay-
ing things.

The game was interrupted by the ap-
proach,of a very large man with gray
moustachios, in uniform, who stopped
and asked if Mr, Oldershaw was at
home) ;

“Are you General Herbert?” asked
Gladys. . eh

“No, I am Colonel Waterman.”

“Papa expects General Herbert to-
day. I supposed you wero he.”

The colonel passed on, and Gladys
turned again to her opponent in tennis
and suggested that ho might be tired
and would. like to go the house and
fest, He admitted that it wag rather

tiresome playing with a game leg, as.

he called it, and he wouldn't mind a
rest, Indeed, he seemed to be quite ex-

hausted with the efforts te had made.
Gladys led him to the porch, pointed to |

a swinging sofa, and when he sat down
on it insisted that he lie at full length
and covered him with an afghan.
“TY think you.

reply. * fa gas:

too long,” she

“What mado you think that man who
asked if your father was at home was
General Herbert?” he asked.

“Ob, he was so big and fierce look-
Ing. Then, too, he was about the right
age for a general.”

“All generals are not old. There aro
generals in the armies in Europe not
over twenty-five years of age.”

“Why, I thought the captains and
Heutenants were about that age.”

“Usually they are, but sometimes a
man gets to be a general earlier.”

“How does he do it?”

“Oh, he loses his head and does
something be wouldn!t dare do in his
calmer momenta. It {6 mistaken for
an act of bravery, and they promote
him, If ho does it often-enough and
doesn’t get himself killed he may reach
the grade of general.”

“T don't think that's a very nice way
of putting it.”

“Ita about true.”

“How do you, a civilian, know any-
thing about such matters?” There was
a touch of irony in this.

“Oh, I have friends who have been
there.”

“IT suppose they wouldn't take you
in the army.”

“Why not?”

“In the first place, you're Jame; be-
sides, you don't Jook very strong. And
all the soldiers I’ve seen are rather
large men.”

“I don't fancy,” said the little man,
“that if I were to present myself for
enlistment as 1 am today I would be
accepted, I couldn’t even be a private
in the rear ranks, Funny, isn’t it?”

Gladys did not see anything funny
about it, but she refrained from saying
60,

“I wonder,” shé said instead, “what
fs keeping Genera) Herbert? Father
said he had a special appointment.”

“I wish for your sake,” said the little
man, “that General Herbert had come
instead of your humble servant.”

“I don't.”

“Why 7

“How do you suppose a girl like me
could entertain him?”

The little man laughed.

“What amuses you?” asked Gladyn,

“That you should suppose that a man
1s a great big noble creature covered
with glory simply bécause he is a gen-
eral. How many generals’ reputations
have Jasted a8 long as that of Alexan-
der Pope, thé poet, who had a miser-
able body and never a well day?”

“Papa contends,” said Gladys
thoughtfully, “that persons admire
thelr opposites. - That evidently isn't
true in your case.”

“I don’t deny that I would prefer a
more imposing stature.” :

“I don't mean that at all. What I do
mean is that you, a delicate, sickly
mati, don't seem to set any great store
by bravery.”

“There are different kinds of brav-
ery. Moral bravery is always admira-
ble. Physical bravery is as liable to be
found in a savage as in the most civi-
lized man. That it is akin to the cour-
age of a beast is evidenced by tho fact
that most men when, they go into a
fight aro frightened’ out of their senses,
When they get into it their brutal na-
ture comes to the surface and they
fight like brutes,”

'- “How do-you know how nien feel
when they go into battle?”

Tho little man showed a bit of con-
fusion at the question, but was equal
to the occasion. He said that he had
read a great deal about soldiers.

“So have I,” the girl retorted. “When
I read about a battle I always wish I
Wero a man and were in it.” :

“T.once read a description of ‘a bat-
tle written by a man who had just

field hospital whére the surgeons wero “| could be expected.

at work. His battle pictures mado me
glad that I wasn’t in it.”

“Ob, I suppose if one is not”—

She got no further. Hearing the
gate close, sho looked around and saw
her father hurrying up the walk. On
reaching the veranda he sald:

“I am sorry, general, to have, kept,

_you waiting for me. But I see that my

Uttle girl has taken good care of you.”
“Your ttle girl bas knocked me out
at tennis.” ‘
“What! Tennis?. With that wound:
of yours? Gindys, what in the world
did you’ permit General Herbert to
play tennis for? You havo endangered
his life.” ~
-Meanwhile Gladys stood mute with

‘astonishment, to say nothing of con-

fusion. It is safid that all the scenes of
a man’s life are rushed before his eyes
when he is drowning. Certain it is that
everything Gladys had said to General
Herbert came up to mock hor.” He
¢ame to her réscue.

“Ob, Miss Gladys didn't Know that I.

gerated view of what a general ehould

er yet had a general command, and
I'm not in a hurry to get one, A bri-
gade {a all I'll get, anyway.”
Gladys retired, Jeaving her father’s
guest to instruct him with regard to
the necessities of the Canadian troops

all puffed out, ldst week, {n anticipa-
tion of a visit from the Bear Cats
of Middle Bass, but those crafty fel-
ines» must have had on intimation of
the fate which was to be meted out
fto them and very wisely stayed home.

Jack Millen, who recently sold bis
farm to the Gardner Bros, hos been
over on the shore Jooking at some of
the farms over there, He says among
other things, that while the crops are
generally very good, {t ain't in it with
Pelee,

Owing to the ‘inclemency of the
weather the fishermen are greatly
handicapped, as the stendy blow
makes it impossible ty set their nets,
as the seas are very” high. Which
harks up back to Shakespeare when
he said: “What little noise man makes
in his short time to thine unceasing
roar.” Now this don’t apply to the
ladies—it means the turbulent waters
}of Lake Erie.

Time was—and not long ago—when
the sterner sex used to take grént de-
light in bringing home their demijohns
full of the spirits that cheer, but this
boon js now denied them, Instead the
good housewives take those self-same
demijohns when going to the store
and get them filled with such peaceful
liquids _as vinegar, molasses and coal
ojl. Really and truly {t sounds lke
the story of the battle axes and board-
ing pikes being turned into plow
shares and pruning hooks.

TILBURY.

Because they wanted to see a train
wreck two Tilbury boys, ane 8 and
the other 9, have confessed that they
deliberately attempted: to™“derall the
fast C. P. R. flyer on August 31st. The
juvenile train wreckers appeared in
police court here Friday and the case4<
was adjourned for a week, when
judgment will be passed; . The C.P.R.
flyer .was partially deratied on Auguts
81st, when the front truck of the en-
gine left the track and plowed up
more than 200 ties before the train
could be stopped. When the ties were
replaced the road's engineers had the
curve grade altered to make it more
safe, if that were possible. This was
due to the belief that the speed of the
train in rounding the curve might
have been responsible for thes acel-
dent. Detective Harper, of the CG. P.
R., investigated, however, and -found
a lerge nut, which had evidently been
runjover. With this as a clue he ran
down the “desperadoes,” ‘and found
them two small lad§. They admitted
that they placed the obstruction,
which was about two inches square, on
the track just before the flyer was
due; and naively confessed that it
was thejr desire to seo‘a train wreck:
In court on Friday the boys substan-
tinted this confession by..2 complete
avowil of the facts.
