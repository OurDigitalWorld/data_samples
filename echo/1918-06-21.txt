showa that during*1917 the total am-
ount of conpensation-awarded. was
$397,085.81, "25 compared with $2,-

——<—$$$—$<—$—$__—_<—

A feeler huts been sent out from Ot-
twwa regardiing the intention of the
Government ito impose “price fixing”
throughout, the couytry very soon.
The dnspfredi despatch says> “That
| price-fixing, which “shall. be general
throughout che Dominion, cannot be
long delayed\. is a theory that is gain-
ing ground. “The declared intention’
of the Unite:l States food administra-
tion. to fix prices in all departments
of fogd supplly to protect the consumer
is an example which is almost bound
to be found jin Canada,”

 

 

About the most, drastic draft enact-
ment yet adlwpted by Canada and the
United States is the “Alien draft con-
vention,” now before the American
Senate for mdoption. Roughly speak-
ing the dratft rules of each country
now-apply ito the citizens of each
‘country wheither at home or abroad.
A Britisher, Canadian or American
can be draftted whether hg Is in Eng-
land, Canadian or the United States,
and he hag jjust two months to decide
whether to enlist or be drafted, The
age limit fs 44 years.

BASEBALL,

 

This great summer? outdoor sport
has the whole town of Amherstburg by
the ears, and scarco @ night goes by,
except Snturdays. and. Sundays, but
crowds of people fron’ not only the
ytown ‘but surrounding districts con-
pregate on. the town, park to cheer
on their respective champlfons: Scien-
tific points are not overlooked even
in the unimportant games, and um-
piresShave to be mighty careful in
their decisions if they do not wish to
be “boohed” off_the fleld, The result
is the development of ball teams from
which later In the season a nine can
be selected which will clean up any
amateur club in the “Southwestern
peninsula while big leagues ‘can easily
secure excellent timber for any new
umpires they may require when Silk
OLaughiit ond BY Evans are no
more. : =

The standing of the teams in the
loca] league up to Wednesday night
is as follows:— :

LEAMINGTON WATERWORKS.

   
   

 
   

A special meeting of the Leaming-
ton council was held° Saturday night
to receive a.repart from Engineer
“Newman and the special committea
on the construction of the proposéd
new 900,000-gallon reservoir.

It was proposed at one time to pur- |.
chase A. Allen's liouse and lot ad-
joining the waterworks at a cost of
$3,000 and Mra, Munday’s house and
Jot ot the rear for $1,100, and con-
struct two rectangular reservoirs at
an estimated cost of $45,000.

It was afterwards discovered that a
better réinforcement of circular reser-
voirs could be secured than for rect-
angular ones, and the report of En-|
gineer Newman and the Special’ Com-
mittee, Saturday night, dealt with the
former.

The report covered the proposal to
now construct two circular reservoirs,
each with a capacity of 450,000 gal-
lons connetted by pipe, giving a total
expacity of 900,000 gallons. .-For this
purpose /t Is proposed to purchase the
following properUés-ffonting on the
south side of Hazelton street, at the
Tear of the waterworks and a little
west: *Mrs. Mundays’ house and lot,
$1,100; J. F, Rupert's house and Jot,
$1,700; Lorne Nifchol’s lot without
the house, $1,200, and Wm. Truax’s
house and lot, $1,800. In addition to
these properties a corner of James
Bvans' lot will be required and a
fright of. way for a pipe line from
Olark street. The estimated cost \jof
the circular reservoirs, Including the:
purchase of thé:properties mentionad
ond an additional three feet to the
present reservoir is $39,000, -or -a
saying of $6,000 as- compared with
the cost of $45,000 for tle rectan-
gular reservoirs.

The report was adopted and the
council passed n resolution to pur-
chase the properties referred to and
secure permiskion for the same from
the Finance Minister at Ottawa,

. The‘combined capacity of the new
and old reservoirs will be 1,065,000
4}igallons, which meets the  require-
ments of the Fire Underwriters’ Ag+
sociation up to a population of 6,000,
