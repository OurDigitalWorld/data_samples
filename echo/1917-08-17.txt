VOTERS’ LISTS.

More light Is being thrown {n the

new Provincial Voters’ List Act every
day since the municipal lists are be-
| ing issued, and the new Act is any-
| thing but pleasing to the many over-
| worked and very often inadequately
} paid township clerks, who looked to
the fees from voters’ list court to sup-
plement their salaries Under the
new Act, voters’ list courts will largely
disappear, as the matter of adding
legislative voters—both male and fe-
male, is entirely removed from the
province of municipal officials, and
will be placed in charge of enumer-
ators.in each municipality, who in the
nature of things will receive their ap-
pointment as @ reward for party ser-
vices, unless the whole system of the
apoils ‘belonging to -tWe victors {sg re-
volutionized.

The y-ters’ Mst fs mode up in’ two
parts tinder the néw Act, part one con-
taining the nomes of those who have
votes {n both. mpnicipal elections and
elections to the Legislative Assembly,
and part 2, consisting of non-resident
owners, Who linve only a right to vote
at munic{pal elections. In part 1 is
found the names of those married
women and widows who own their
OW property or are tenants, and ss
usual’ the number {fs negligible

The elimination of part 3, which for-
merly contained the names of electors”
only quallfled to vote at legislative
elections leaves room for some criti-
clsm, not only on the ground of out:
ting municipal clerks out of théir just
fees, but fo secure the names of the
male and female electors entitled to
vote’ at legislative elections, a cum-
bersome and expensive method is em-
ployed. A registration board for each
county consisting of the judges, Crown
Attorney, Sheriff, Registrar and Local
Master, sits in judgment They ap-
point a clerk of their Board, and
enumerators for each polling subdi-
vision in the county, whose duty it is
to make a house tayhouse canvass for
thirty days of more, if necessary, and
enumerate all the voters (male and
female) not on the original voters’ list,
Who are entitled by age and citizen:
ship, to vote, and after: these are re:
vised, other Noters' lists are issued for
each municipality, then the two voters’

Iists—that Issued by the municipality,

and the other by the Registration
Board, are the combined Hst of quali-
fled voters for each municipality.

That js, insterd of the voters in each
voters’ list being determined by the

ssment roll and the appeals upheld

y the Judge at the court of revision,
afer 30 days from the issuance of
each municipal list, we hayve-practical-
ly the original machinery, and’ thfs
new and wonderful county registration
machine =with Ita additional expense
during time when heads of govern,
mint. food> controllers and what not
fre urging the people to save, save,
save, Municipal clerks think that what
they save {a doubly spent on political
heelers who wwill get the'job of enum-
erating the voters.

Instead of. n cumbersome Registra-
tion Board as provided under tho Act,
& Board composed of

Judges would be less liable to-error?

and_more likely to give entire satisfac
tion. -In Essex county the Judge's rul-
ings in voters’ lists appeals have been
unquestioned,

A new measure for the taking of
soldiers’ votes. was introduced at the
opening of the Dominion Parliament.
Mondhy, by Judge Doherty. The
minister stated that since the first bill
conditions had greatly altered. Those
qualified 10 vote were five or six times
AS mumerous as when the bill was
originally introduced ~ dnd ° the trans-
portation. of bellots has» become more
difficult. “All soldiers, naval service:
men ‘of Canadn\and persons in the Im-
perin! service, those who were being
enrolled .in Canada; May vote. Minor
soldiers may vote and 80 May nurses
and Indians. The bill provides mach{n-
ory for taking the ballot overseas prac-

tically as though-an élection were be- [J

ing held there. The votes will be
counted oVersens: by special returning
oMcers. ‘Elaborate provisions are to
be made for taking the soldier ‘vote
{n the coming election.. There is to be
i complete election organization cre-
ated-in England snd France. To en-
able the men {n uniform to become ac-
quainted with the issues and the can-
didates, the bill introduced Monday by
the Minister of Justice provides=that
there shall be four weeks between the
nomination and thespolling. This will
considerably lengthen. the campaign.
The four weeks’ time applies to the
elvilian voting in Canada as wéll as to
the soldier-vote athe front. The new
law is called the “military voters’ act,
1917." The Minister of Justice ob.
tained’ first reading for, it * Mondayr
Judgé Doherty stated: that this law
would supercede that of two years ago,
by which the soldiers were given votes,

What Was the “Rakeoff’?7

Now, the question has been fre
ty ratsed what rekeoff did t)

Windsor tracks claim during
weeks’ marvellous flow of

The amount has been variously
Mated at from 10 sor20 per cent™
cording to the estimators, at ‘te
per cent. was extracted, from the total
amount in straight bets at each track.
Hugh Grant Browne.-principal owner
of Devonshire, admitted this percent-
Age was correct. so far as his plant
was concerned.

The “rakeoft” of the place and show
bets looked to be considerably larger

_ than the amount taken from the
Straight wagers at @nch track.

Basing the average rakeoff at 15 per
cent. for all the three tracks, the own-
ers of the games coilected in round
figures $1,000,000 for tribute:

Of this immense protit the Canadian
Government received $1,250 per day.
or $45,000 for the 28 days’ racing, paid
for by Detroiters and péripatetic Can-
adjans.” This equalled 4% per cent. of
the profits.

It it true the Government received a
fax of 25 cents for each admission.
but this come out of the pockets of
te public, and did not interfere ma-
terially with the profit of the track-
owners.

CANADA'S AMA™=UR SOLDIERS.

During the course of an investiga-
tion at+Ottiwa one of the witnesses,
in reply to a question, said that the
person in charge of a canadian hos-
pital board should be a*professional
soldier.. Mr. Pardee, chief Liberal

|whip, pointed out that in Canada we

have no professional soldiers, . and
with that fact In mind Edward W.
Reynolds has*contributed to The Can-
adian Magazine for August an article
telling who are the men who, though
amprteura, have made good as soldiers
at the Front. He gives, sketches of
the coreers and military exploits of
men such as Lieutehant-General Cur-
ry, Brigadier-General Mercer, Briga-
dier-General McRae, Lieutenant-Gol

CATARRH CANNOT BE CURED
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS, as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease.
Catarrh {is a blood or constitutional
disease, and in order, to cure it you
must take internal remedies. Hall's
Catarrh Cure is taken internally, and
acts directly on the blood ‘and’ mucous
surfaces; Hall's Catarrh Cure is not
a quack medicine. It was prescribed
by one of the best physicians of this
cjuntry.for years and {s a regular
prestription. It {s composed of the
best tonics known, combinéd with.the
best. blood purifiers, acting directly
on the mucous surfaces, The perfect
combination of the two ingredients
is what produces such wonderful re-
sults =n curing catarrh. Send for
