WiAT SAILORS HAVE DONE.

 

Next Saturday, December Sth, will
be wlors’ day throughout the Domin-
fon, and an’ effort will be mado to ob-
tain ‘fom our people some substantial
recognijon of the work that the men
of the navy and mercantile marine
have dme. Sea power has been an
enormois factor in this war, Tho
niercanijie marine, it fs pointed out,
has suceesstully carried 12,000,000 of
men and 16,000,000 tons of war ma-
terial; 1.500,000 of sick and wounded,
60,000,00 gallons of petrol, over 1,250,-
000 horses and wuled, 120,000,000
cwts.-of Wheat, 7,500 000 tons of iron
ore, over $853,000,000 aterling worth
of goods have been exported. We
have Jevt ’'rance 700 ships and 450 to
Italy, Our lines of comiunication: by
sea are (ully as important as those by
land.

But while we all recognize this, we
are perliaps apt to regard the navy as
an |mpersonal thing, and to think of
dt In terms of guns and tonnage, rath-
ler than in terms of men, Upon this
