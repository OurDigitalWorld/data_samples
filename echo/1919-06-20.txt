ART OF SELECTING DRAPERIES

Wise Choosing and Placing of Lamps
Lends an Air of Coziness to
the Home.

While the selection of draperies and
curtains is, possibly, the most obvious
method of lénding an alr of coziness
to the home, the wise choosing and
placing of Inamps 1s a factor which ts
equally important, though too infre-
quently taken odvantage of. To be
thoroughly comfortable and practical
during the evening hours, the home
should be equipped with a variety of
lamps, to meet the particular needs of
the moment. The fact that one doe
not want the same kind of lighting a
all times becomes an important item
{n the selection and arrangement of
fixtures, for, while a soft, mellow glow
is highly desirable for conversational
purposes, it Is usually insuffielent for
reading or other close work. The liv-
ing room should therefore be fur-
nished with both types ‘of Immps, so
that it will be satisfactory at ol} times.
Proper illumination of this roem will
do much toward keeping the fomlly
together In the evening, for It makes
it possible for severnl people to do
their different work in comfort.

brings us to realizé what the last
northeaster which swept our island
ard almost meant total destruction to
our cropssand homes. The waters
swept in from the lake in torrents, and
if the storm had kept up: fhree hours
longer the lowlands. would have been
covered with from two to three feet
of water. Now our represéntative,

witnessed the havoc wroscht, and he
said that ho would tjie steps immed-

GREEN FORAGE CROPS ‘
AID TO LAMB FEEDERS

In sections of the state where per-
manent »pastures *are not abundant
‘lambs may be fattenéd by the use of.
annual pasture crops, “according to
tests at the Ohio Experiment Station.
Also the use of green forage crops
4s of an unusual advantage to the
corn-belt farmer as he may then be
able to get his lambs on the market in
good condition-egrly in the autumn so
that they will not have to compete
with the heavy runs of range jambs. |

en-forage crops found to be of
advantage in lamb fattening are rape,
Tye and clover. Rape has proven
quite profitable as a green forage crop
for as much as $86 an acre jas been
secured from this pasture, an acre
carrying 22 lambs for 83 days and
producing 676 pounds of gain. Lambs
were valued at $15 a hundred pounds,

Professor Swanson, dean of the Poll-

versity of Saskatchewan, spoke the
trith when, addressing the Retail Mer-
chants of that Province recently, he
said: “It hag been almost the policy
of Canada; 40 Took. ‘wpon’ the thrifty
man as mean «aid narrow in his out-
dook upon life. We have admired the
land spéculator and the man who
made and spent money, but the war
has ténded to change this.”

The War Savings campaign with Its
War Savings and, Thrift Stamps is fol-
lowing up the opportunity created by
jthe war. It is giving the people the
eorrect perspective It is. bringing
j home to them the foolishness of waste.
It 18 teaching them to invest wisely,

Moreover, the campaign is making
it easy for the people to save, because
it enables them to purchase War Sav-
ings Stamps, which are the soundest
sesible investment and which pay
well. :

The NEW
KIT SET
No. 20

A perfect shaving edge is the daily privilege of the Gillette Safety
Razor owner.

Few men can hone or strop a razor sharp enough to stop it pulling
on the neck and around the awkward places. With a Gillette you do
not depend upon your own skill in stropping and honing.

The perfection of the edges of Gillette Blades is assured by our
highly specialized machinery.

The new Kit Set shown above is most compact (especially convenient
when you go away for a holiday or on business,)and enables you to enjoy
the most comfortable shave in a few minutes every morning.

Despite handicaps caused by the
war, the Pennsylyunia University tu-
seum has ‘acquired many relics un-
earthed at Memphis by its Egyptiuo
expedition, A vessel will be char-
tered to transport the relics.

The expedition started on its trip
in March, 1915, and continued explor-
ations until last June, when the short-
age of labor and the high prices of
materials due to the war, caused a
cessation. in the work,

Old-Fashioned Flint Lock Sald to Have
Been Brought to Wisconein
Town by Southerner.

Danlel Boone'y rifle, a genuine old-
fushloned flint lock, exrried by Boone
on many a perilous trip in the dark
und bloody hunting ground of Ken-
tucky and on his fumous Indian hunt
ing expeditions, was recently brought
into u hardware store in a small town
in southwestern Wisconsin for much

} needed repairs. It is now the prop-

sissippl, who recently traded his 2,300
acre plantation for Wisconsin property
and has moved his effects north. The
rifle was given him by a doctor, to
whom it had been given by an aged
hermit living in the mountains of Ten-
nessee,

The rifle fs a formidable affair, a
real “long rifle,” one of the type that
wave the nickname of the “long rifles”

; to our western fronuersmen. It has
a barrel 46 inches long, is 45 caliber,
a filnt lock with a patchbox of in-
laid silver, and welghs ten pounds.
The end of the butt is set, with a wild
bour’s tusk, and has the double or set
trigger. On the side of the stock are

“Boon's “Tru Fren,” on the walnut
stock the initials D. B. and five most
Significant and sinister notches, each
notch standing for “one good Injun.”

charged soldiér or sailor, Some are
lucky enough to return immediately

ROSY CHEEK

in a Rich, Red and Pure
Condition.

When a girl—or a woman—finds
her color fading, when her cheeks
and lips grow pale, and she gets short
Ce of breath easily and her heart palpl-
tates after the slightest exertion, it
means that she is suffering from anne-
mia—thin, watery blood, Headache
andbackache frequently -accompany
this ‘condition, and nervousness {is
often present,

The remedy for this, condition is to
build up the blood, and for this pur-
pose. there Is no medicine that can
equal Dr, Willlams’- Pink Pilla, ‘They
build up and renew the blood, bring
brightness to the eyes, color to the
cheeks, and a general feeling of re-
newed health and energy, The only
other treatment needed {fs plenty of
sunlight, . moderate exercise and
good, plain food. The girl or woman
who gives this treatment a fair trial
will soon find hersélf- entoying per-
fect health.
No. 1, Lyndhurst, says: “I cannot
syeak too highly of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, for I believed they saved
my daughter's life. She was in. a
terribly run down condition, pale,
wan, and despondent, and people who
saw her considered-her in a_deeline.
The doctor who treated her did not
help her any, and then I decided to
give her Dr.’. Williams’ Pink Pills.
The decision proved a wise one, for
before six boxes were used she was
much better. I got six more boxes,
and before they were gone she was
in the best of health. When she be-
gan the use of the pills she weighed
only 90 pounds, and under their use
her welght increased to 127 pounds.
I strongly urge all mothers of weak
girls to give them Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills.”

You can get Dr. Wiliams’ Pink Pills
from any dealer in medicine, or by
mail post paid at 50c a box or six
boxes for $2.50 from the Dr, Wil-
liams’ Medicne Co., Brockville, Ont.

Mr. and Mrs. Ira Brush, Marshfield,
were: greatly pleased with the return
.| of their son, Pte. Aretas J. Brush, who
arrived Sunday morning after spend-
ing elghtéen months in the army over-
seas. He {s in the pink of: condition,
His sisters from Amherstburg and
Detroit gathered home on Sunday to
meet him and spent a happy day. On
Monday night about sixty of his
friends and neighbors surprised him
by presenting him with a-gold watch
chain, William Deslippe making the
presentation, Earl Deslippe read the
address as ‘follows: “To-night we
have one of the grandest occasions that

hood in «welcoming home Pte. A. J.

the address wis rendered the young
hero arose and’ made an appropriate
reply, thanking the people {dF their
kindness, after which the” evening
was spent in music and dancing, which
everyone enjoyed to their, heart's con-
tent, and at 12 o’clock.a dainty lunch
of sandwiches, cake “and coffee was
served. When the gathering was about
to depart-they were called to order
and Ira\Brush gave a brief address
thanking them for the honor bestowed
upon his son. Pte, Brush was met
on histarrival by Joel Craig, of Walk-
erville, and they motored dewn Sun-
day morning. Just north of McGregor
the roads were exceédingly * slippery
owing to the récent rain, and the car
swerved into the ditch. Joel thought

CONTROL DISEASE

 

leg and Rhizoctonia.

 

Since it {6 financially profitable to
prevent potato diseases every grow-
er should do his part to ald in the con-
trol of the diseases already prevalent
in his district and to prevent the intro-
duction of new ones, Potatoes are
affécted by a large number of dis-
euses which cause a considerable an-
nual finanelal loss, and much of this
loss can be prevented by using proper
control. methods, Leaf diseases can
be controlled very largely by spraying
with Bordeaux mixture; wilt diseases
and. stem rot can be controlled by
rogueing fields of rotating crop. But
the matter that concerns the grower
at this particular seasson is that of
ensuring seed against the action of
disease that is contained therein in
comparatively dormant form, and the
treatment. indicated in case of.a
suspicion of the presence of either
blacklegy scab or Rhizoctonia {5 that
of immersion of the seed in a solution
of corrosive sublimate, together with
the observance of precautions against
the carrying,of infection by means of-
the tools’ Uzed In cutting the tubers
fev seed,

Poth formaldehyde ond corrostve
;sublimate are commonly used fon dia-
infecting seed tubers. They are Gen-
erally considered about 4qually ef:
fective against common ttitb, but
there is good evidence that corrosive
sublimate {8 now effective against
Hrizoctonia, results indicating this
fact having been obtained at expert-
ment,stations both here and in the
United States, These results.of Iabor-
atory and greenhouse ‘tests suggest
the advisability of using corrosive
sublimate in preference to formalde-
hyde if Rhizoctonia must be consid-
ered in seed dlsinfection, Formalde-
hyde is not poisonous, although the
fumes are annoying, but corrosive
sublimate must not be eaten: or fed
to stock. The solution should be
handled in wooden vessels because it
corrodes most metal.

The corrosive sublimate solution for
disinfecting potato seed is made up as
follows: Corrosive sublimate, 4
ounces; water, 30 gallons. Dissolve
the corrosive sublimate in & gallons
of hot water, then add 25 gallons of
water... Soak-the tubers’ an !sour and
