School opening September 3rd draws near, and mothers are think-
ing of necessary wearables—it requires some cogitation these days

to find what one wants at suitable price. A perusal of the following
list will offer some suggestions.

‘Dress Fabries in Wool and Cotton ?

We have still some pretty, attractive wool materials for the mak-
ing of blouses and dresses—serges and fancy weaves. A little work
and effort will sometimes effect quite a saving on a garmen nt—ready

made.
We have good assortments of cotton fabrics as well—ginghams,
percales, plain weaves, and fancy work

Dresses-. Ready ly Made

Lots of good ones to be picked up. Cotton dresses such as
hams and prints, which will do for several months of fall we

and pretty garments can be had for a al 2 outlay. We hav
up to 14 and 16 years. And some exc t serge dresses, ¢ kind
which will wear and wash—in navy, b k and a few other colors. Any
of these garménts are away cheaper than our fall offerings will be,
so now is the logical time to purchase. Size§ are broken, but yét
plenty for nearly all needs.

In Pre-War-times we put forth every effort and searched all the markets to buy staple lines as cheaply as possible. Manufac-

turers selling these commodities were barely- making an existence, and the same with their employees, To-day things have
changed. Prices -have advanced, and all Operators, Machinists, Manufacturefs and Farmers are participating in the prosperity
that follows in the wake of WAR. We all know that high WAGES designate Prosperity, consequently we have searched all the

markets to secure the BEST VALUES, so that quality will remain long after the price is forgotten.

2 The men of the Merchant Marine have given loyal service

They deserve the utmost we can do for them!

recognized by governments, no provision is made for the -
relief of dependents—no separation allowance—no pension ?
qg It is left to public ‘subscription to care for the widows and

the supplies and’ munitions carried by the Merchant Marine
it would be impossible to keep our armies in the field,

sunk’ since the war began, without leaving trace of ship,

All this is in the Allies’ cause—it is for as! «Isn't it the

very least we can do, to take care of the widows and orphans,

the opiniom that the day of the*town

This seems to be a well-founded state-
ment, for a few weeks ago the wife
of a wage-earner in a nearhy town
wanted to get a sult of clothes for her
little boy. She first visited the local
stores that séll-that clase of goods,

FUTU RE OF GRAPE-GROWING.

 

Raisin Varieties to Take the Place

The right spirit fs exhibited by the
growers of grapes heretofore usud
chiefly in the making. of wine in their
determination to do no crying over
spilt milk in the event that the wine
industry- is adwersely affected by
legislation. Alredy some of them are
grafting thelr vines te meisin marietivs.
Others no doubt will find some ‘totally
different crop equally profitable. Staple
food crops are beginning to lbring
returns to the grower far greater than
they did a fewsyears ago. The, pro-

Nolselessly the man with a bent wire
opened the gate of a rear court, cau-

Bill groped his way without a mis-
step, down a corridor and up a filght
of stnirs, for he had’ pursued that
course only a week agone—and had
got away with the swag! In his pocket
at the present moment lny that same
plunder, a diamond-Jeweled wrist
watch, a pearl necklace, two valuable
rings. He could see a Iight coming
through a keyhole.

“Thunder!” Bill expressed volceless-

could have guffawed, for the man with-

a chisel and a screw driver. Bill could
not refrain-a chuckle at the sight of
this kit.

“A rival,” he muttered—“but an ama-

With the hearty salutation, Bill

me to become what I was. Now, then,
let’s have the dope,” he added ten min-
utes Inter, ns he and the strange new
friend he: had made were seated in a
secluded corner of an eating room.

“IT am Arthur Ridgely,” spoke Bill's
companion promptly, “reasonably well

young Indy, The man whose house we
visited tonight admired her, demanded

“The father had gone wrong, eh?”

“I wont your address,” sald the tat-
ter, fairly trembling with emotion.)

“My city ono changes tomorrow, for

and Bill gave the details as to name
and location,

One month later Bill was whistling

a cheery tune in the rear yard of his
new home, and his happy-faced wife
was singing as she bent over the wash-
tub under a flowering cherry tree. Ab-
ruptly an automobile turned from the
road, halted and Arthur Ridgely sprang
out. ‘
“Dear friend!” cried the exuberant
young man, selzing Bill's hand in a
fervor of joy. “We haven't forgotten
you.”

“My wife,” spoke Bill proudly, nod-
ding to the smiling Indy at the clothes-
line.

“Two brides! Angela,” called Ridge-
ly, and she alighted from the machine.

“Good friend, indeed!” she cried to
Bull. “You darling!” she directed at
Mra/ Dorsey, as she threw her arms
around her neck and kissed her.

“You look very happy here, Mr. Dor-
sey,” observed Ridgely.

“Happy!” cried his buxom wife.
“He's whistling at bis work all day
long and I have to sing to keep from
crying for joy.” >

“It's just paradise,” declared Bill.
“We've got a lense on the little place
for ten dollars a month and a promise
of the use of five acres adjoining.”

“You needn’t pay any more ret,”
said Ridgely, and he extended a folded
document. y

“What's that?” questioned Bill.

“Ite a deed to the house and lot
and the fivo acres, free and clear—a
belated wedding present, Angela’s and
mine,” was Arthur Ridgely’s reply,
