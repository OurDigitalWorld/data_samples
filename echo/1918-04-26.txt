The deputation was received with
much cordjality and the question of
extending the Essex Terminal to the
Town of Amherstburg was thoroughly
discussed jn an_informal way by all,
The officials gave the deputation «
very sympathetic hearing, asking for
information on various points “so. as
to become acquainted not only with
the »possibilities of an Amlierstburg
connection in business why, but also
the best route to reach the’ town in
the event of their deciding to extend
thelr line,

Both Mr. McMath and Mr. Woollatt
Made inquiries as to the possibility of
securing factory sites along the river
front and Jed a round table discussion
on the important development ques-
ons that confront Amherstburg and
will have to be dealt with shortly in
order to consolidate and reap full ad-
vantage of the prosperity occasioned
by the establishment of the Brunner,
Mond. here,

A map of the town was submitted,
and facts as to the number of cars and
the volume of business handled here %
now were laid-before the officials, and
Proposals made as tolthe route which |
might be followed.

Messrs. McMath and Woollatt, while
making no promises, took the matter
under consideration and asked’ {or
further information, whi¢h will be sub-
mitted to them.

John the Baptist R, Cy church a week
ago Sunday evening. The sacred edi-
flce was. crowded to the doors, and
the services In connection with the
dedication were very solemn and im-
pressive. Rey. Fr. Donnelly in an
eloquent oration spoke with much
depth of feeling on the great neces-
ality for service throughout the world,
developing his*theme from the texts:
“The Son of Man came to minister.
not,to be ministered unto,” and dwelt
on/the various forms of service ex-
pected of men, the best form of which
is service to God. s .

Come Early! :

Take Our Advice, Mrs. Homedressmaker. Don’t De-
lay, but Make Selection of Your Yard Materials Before the

‘May .Rush Begins.

Times are not like what they were when we could telegraph an
order for several pleces of such-and-such fabric and have it here in
three or four days. Much less can we now hope to renew all our
present stocks at former prices; although it {fs quite true some
standard cotton materials will remain at early season prices for a
ttle while at least. But better come early and avold any disap-
pointments.

Among the pretty things are Fancy Volles in dress lengths, silk
and cotton mixtures, including the popular dark effects,$6.00, $8.00,

$8.50, $9.00 pattern.

VOILES in pretty checks, dots, voiles. figures,
at 50c; this is a special. Also 75¢ and 85c.

A. K. McLeen, acting Minister of
Finance, in the budget for the fiscal
year 1918-19, was expected to am
nounce on Thursday that Canada must
raise 500,000,000 more for war, neces-
sitating about $253,000,000. by increas-
ed taxation and borrowing. Plans for
obtaining the new funds may be made
public at the same time. Canada’s
national debt {s now $1,106,394,000,
an increase of $770,000,000, due to the
war. Fixed interest charges now total
$78,000,000 and pensions $16,000,000.
Total Canadian expenditures on the
war to date reaches $835,000,000, of
which $66,000,000 has been derived
from revenue. Excess profits, igcome

to have known better, were rounded
up and summoned to appear in court
