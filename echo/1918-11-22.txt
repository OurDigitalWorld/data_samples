Little they cared as they filed from the Barrack Room,
Shoulder to shoulder, if need be, to die,
Was there one flinched? Not aboy, not a hoy of them;
Straight on they marched td the dread battle’s brunt—
Fill up your glasses and drink to them, all of them,
Canada’s call found them all at the front.

won't mind warming mine over.”

Myra, comfortably settled in the
énslest cheir of the aitting room, lazily
waved a siim, white hand to her
mother's cheery good-by, a d‘ turning
townrd the window watched the lively
ttle body cross the street and join
severn) other dear mother people on
the corner. Myra laughed scornfully.

“I'm surprised. at mother; such a
motley crowd, tall, short, fat, lean,
rich and poor.”

Myra, however, failed to 4ake note
of the one connecting nk among the
women. Each one carried a huge sew-
ing bag and everyone from old Mrs.
McCane's worn brown lining wour
strosity to the wealthy Mrs, Van
Eaton's creation of satin and rivbon
was overflowing with its burden of
brown’ and gray yarn and partially
finished garments for Uncle Sam’s
koldier boys. _

Myra yewned and turned lazily to
a hook fo her lap, but somehow she
could not get interested. A coming
party was uppermost In her mind and
she was having rosy visions of her-
self In the new satin gown which she
had ordered just that morning. She
wns wondering if she could get slippers
to match the delicate hue of hor dress
material, and if she had better have
her hair done by a-_halr dresser or trust
to her own nimble fingers to get Just
the correct anjount of wave into the
glossy strands of bronze. Pleasant
reveries’ were interrupted .by the {n-
sistent pealyof the telephone bell.

Her enger greeting of her dearest
chum was cut short in horrified dis-
may.

“Cut out the party? Sitrely, you
mist be mistaken, Dora—why I or-
dered’ my dress today. On account of*
the war? My soul. This old war makes
me tired. I-don’t see what this country
got into It for, anyhow. \ T wish to
goodness I-lived in a warless age
. . « -What’s that—make comfort
bags instead of dance? Well, of all
the nonsense, No, I won'thelp. It
makes me tired. No, I eaid, Dora.

‘ Myra ‘returned to her easy chair,
pouting dreadfully. She caught up the

   
 
 
  

{t to.a far corner of the library table.
Her childish spite thus. appeased, she
slumped. down Into the luxuriant
depths-of’the chair afid sulked herself
to sleep. j

Her. brother awakened her later by
filnging. the morning newspaper into
her Inp. Myra turned lazily to the
woman's prge and rend ‘the fashion
talk first. Then she skimmed the love-
lorn letters and read the next chapter
fo o thrilling serial of love and ad-
venture. That digested, she turned in
a bored fashion to the jokes,

One or two rather acandolous hend-
lines caught her eye, but as far as the
remainder of the paper was, concerned
it might jurt as well have been blank.

Her brother finally’ turned wistful
eyes toward the feminine heap in. the
easy chair.

‘aypful, isn't it?” he inquired glum-

den were coming just behind us and
fiey. too. would come across the snake,
qhough I remonstrated, boldly he took
neavy stones and crushed the menac
ing creature before the other children

She paused reriniscently, and then,
as If some sudden understanding had
taken possession of her, her eyes wid-
ened and a new light came Into their
dark depths.

“Oh Rob, I never thought about it in
that lght’ before, but what Bert did
that dny was what be tried to do when
he.enlisted, wasn't it?- It'g Just what
all the soldier boys are trying to do—

come after. .I see it all now. Oh what
fn selfish’creature I’ve been! Oh Rob,

Sobbing, she turned shamed eyes to
her brother, and he, boyishly caught
her against his shoulder and patted her
tausled head comfortingly. After she
had quieted down a bit he arranged
the chair pillows about her in a some-
what embarrassed fashion, ond then
stood before her eager eyes: asking the
question whieh his parted lips were
shyly refusing to do,

Myra sensed the situation {mmedi-
ately, a8 she looked up Into his face,
She sighed n bit wogfally, but there
was real bravery in her voice as she
said wistfully:

“I know what you are aching to ask,
Nob, seeing that I have been the ob-
fector until now.” oes

“Until now—does that mean that
you consent, Sia?”

She nodded, though St cost her a-
brave effort.

“Yes, I couldn't say otherwise now,
Rob. Uncle Sam needs every. young
man, and—and Bert’s plnce in the
ranks Is empty.”

“Thank you, Sis, he does need us,
every one, and I’ve wanted so much to
nnswer the call. 1 know mother'll be
pind.”

An hour Inter, when Mrs. Crane en-
teréd the house, smiling™happlly with
the thonght of a morning well spent, a
distinct odor of scorched potatoes
crept up her nose. Hurrying Into the
kitchen through the sitting room, a
surprising sight met her eyes,

Molly, . supremely unconscious of
hurnt potatoes, was busily superintend-
Ing the cutting out of a big red cross,
while Myra's untrained fingers were
clumsily following {nstructions. _The*
boy. whisthng happily. was gathering
np the remains of tan silk, from svhich
fhe dainty sewing bag, hanging across
the chair arm, hnd been cut.

At a glance the mother knew that
something unusual had happened, and
burnt “potatoes ard everything else
were forgotten until, she heard the
story of the casualty list and how It
had awakened the heart of her daugh-
ter at last, $

With her arms about her daughter,

the mothet’s eyes looked over the
bronze tresses and smiled bravely,

prondly at her son, who was soon to
be one of Uncle Sam's soldier boys.

“Myra 1!"
There was a new note in her broth-

er's voice. She glanced up quickly,
and the expression on his face made
her get slowly to her feet, her eyes
wide and questioning.

“Don't you dare tall like that,” he
continued, huskily. ““An old party—
and real men dying for their country
and for right. Read that.”

Mechanically she took thé sheet he-
held out to her and, glanced over {t4
carelessly, a8 though o cursory look
would reveal the cause of his pertur-
pation. “Do you mean*thls, Bob? Why,
it's only o list of the ensualties,” she
said, reprovingly, af though such a list
could be of no special Interest to them.

“Only! Rend 'em, T said.” ,

Dumfounded, she read them down
Suddenly she stiffened, peered closer at
the printed sheet and then turned tna
bewlldered fashion to her brother.

“T@can't. be he, Rob; why, Bert was
only a boy—Jjust a boy—he can't be
dead.” ‘

‘qt js true. He was obly a boy, but

he died for his country, while: you—

hate to give up an old party.”

She did not heed the reproof. Star-
ing at the fomiliar mime, she was. hark-

port from atiagae every team captain
at the Friday night meeting in the
Windsor armory for formal returns
in connection with the Victory Loan
campaign in Essex county. with the
result thatthe district is now on the
way to at least a 93,000,000 objective,
having gone beyond the $5,000,000

ark.
ai fact, so fast and unexpected did
the quota achievements come in, par-
ticularly from the rural communities.
that the supply of honor flags, the
prize for “going over.” was soon ex
hausted and temporary substitutes had
to be provided.

From all parts of the county came
gratifying reports. among those win-
ning flags being Belle River. Tilbury
North, Colchester South, Rochester,
Leamington and Kingsville. while
Sandwich, Amberstburg and other
places got extra crowns for flags al-

THE FALL OF AUTOCRACX

Close Study of. the Past Four Years
Shows That Democracy’ Won the
Victory Because the Foes of
Civilization Were Never Abie to |
Drive Home a Blow at a Vital |
Spot.

URING the first two weeks of
last July, the Allies were |
facing the darkest days of |
the war, and the German |
war lords were proclaiming tri-
umphantly that they were about to
achieve the victory that would bring |
them the world domination, which
was the Kaiser's ambition. The Brit-
ish troops with their ‘backs to the |
wall,” to use the phrase of Field |
Marshal Haig, weré fighting to keep |
the Teutons from reaching the Chan-
nel ports, and farther south,

the ‘troops secund from Russia tn
an effort to knak Italy out of the
war. For a vweek it looked as
though the story of Roumania and
Serbia would be repeated, but. the
crisis passed, and Italy more than
retrieved herself in the two great
battles of the Piave, fought in June
and October of the present year.
Germany found fod for exultation
im the failure of the Gallipoli cam-
Daign gnd the defeat of the British
at Knt-el-Amara. The Allies met
with these disasters at the hands of
the Turks, but the British, with
characteristic persistence, went at it
again, and the Ddrilliant victories in
Mesopotamia resulted in the collapse
of Turkey. It wag in the cast that
the first signs came, about two
months ago, that the Central Powers
were going down to ignominious and
humiliating defeat.

It is possible now to look over the
war and to place our fingers on the
black periods of depression, but it
is also easy to follow the golden line
that led to the final victory of the
Allies, The ultimate good of civitiza-
tion made it necessary thet the En-
tente should win, It was a struggle
between reaction and progress, and
the. purpose that one can trace in
history made -thoughtful men feo)
that it was impossible for reaction
to triumph in the long run. The
Prussian war lords made compleie
plans to conquer the world. and

nes it did not seem possibbe tha
hey would fail, but they reckoned
withéut the eternal purpose in his-
tory. AS Hilliare Belloc said: of the
first Battle of the Marne. The Ger-
mans had made every cateulation
that the human brain could devise
to make certain of Victory, but “It
was not to be.””

The effect of the Great War on
Ganade aecs alrcady mauf itself ap>

conflict as soon as the Germans threw
down the challenge of batue... Canada

ay be proud, ¢hiefly because her
record !s the record of the Canadian
people. They rose to the call, and
gave of their money and their young
Hife-in the cause of civilization. To
Our armies histosy will give the cre-
dit of several of the most vital vic-
tories on the Western front” History
will doubtless also ‘ray of the Dom-
inion that the great mass of Canu-
dian citizens preved true to thelr
loftiest ideals of devotion and self-
sacrifice. If we did not have the In-
splring leadership thateguided some
People, like the Greeks, almost. un-
willingly todo their duty, that fact
makes the achievement of the Cana-
dian people .all the more - notable.
History will say that in this etrugele
our young nation found its soul.
