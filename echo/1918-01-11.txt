Autointoxié¢ation means self-poison-
ing, caused by continuous or partial

constipation, or insufficient action of

the bowely.

Tnstead of the refuse matter passing
daily from the ‘body, it is absorbed by
the blood. Asa result, the Kidneys and
Skin are overworked, in their efforts to
rid the blood of this poisoning.

Poisoning of {he bloodin this way often
causes Indigestion, Loss of Appetite
and Disturbed Stomach: It may. pro-
duce Headaches and Sleeplessness. /¢
maytrritate the Kidneys-and bring on
Pain in the Back, Itheumatism, Gout,
and Rheumatic Pains. Itjis the chief
cause of Eezema—and keeps the whole
system nnheallhy by the constant absorp-
tion into the blood’ofthis refuse matter.

Food Ccntrotier Says Prices-Must Not
Go eByand Present Level.

 

Higher prices for potatoes than
now prevailing will not be permitted.
The Food Controller is sending a let-
ter to this effect to all wholesale hand-
lers of potatoes, stating that any at-
tempt to secure higher prices will be
dealt with promptly. If retail, dealors
shouldyattempt to charge an unreason-
able profit On potatoes, the Food Con-
trotler Is prepared toofix the margin
of ‘profit .and if necessary to fix max-
imum prices, In 2 statement {ssued
Friday night Mr. Hanna sald:

“A recent survey of the situation
by this office indicates*that there is
still a-large supply of potatoes in the
hands of the growers and dealers sut-
ficient to meet p continuous and heayy
demand until the 1918 crop wil] be
avajlable.
should Understand the situation clear-
ly and realize that o special effort’to
Keep the public plentifully supplied
at reasonable prices is necessary in
order that no part of tie Jarge crop
of the last season be’ wasted.

“In order to prevent possible loss
later in the season the Winter moye-
ment of potatoes must be stimulated,
by every possible means. Potatoes are
the only food- of which Canada has a
Jorge surplus not in great demand for

 

export. No effort should be spared,
therefore, in using all the potatoes
that can be aeten.”

HOGS MAY BE FED ea

That pigs on a nm which approx:

fitably be carried to a heavier weight

recently completed at the Okie Ex-
Periment Station to determine the
effect of age on the raie and economy
of gains, Shortly after weaning time
in the first test 25 pigs were placed
on a ration of ten yarts of corn, four
parts of middiings, end one part of
Hankage. In t fest a yation
of corn and tankage wis. fed. Be-
ginning with the ration of elght parta
parts of corn arid one of tankage the
proportion’ of corh«was increased one-
fourth part weekly for the®* firgt .24
weeks and remained constant there-
after. The plan followed in the second
test seemed more efficient. .

From birth td 166 pounds the pigs
ate 31844 pounds of feed for 100
pounds oY gain In Hye welght; from
100, to 200 pounds they ate 3615-0;
from 200 to-300 pounds they ate 434%;
from "300 to 400 pounds they - ate
4502-7; and from 400 to 500- pounds
they ate 497% pounds for 100 pownds

A Story of the French
Revolutien.

By JAMES BRAINARD

 

   

Troth is so much stranger than fiction
that perhaps it is better to state that
the main incident of this story actually
happened just as it is recorded,

The French revolution had reached
that stage> commonly designated the
relgn of terror,’ Hvéry, day the doors of
the Conciergerie prison, opened to let
out a number of human’ beings not to
‘Tife, liberty and the pursult of happi-
ness,” ag was enunciated shortly %
fore by the American colonists in qhelr
Declaration..of Independence, but to
