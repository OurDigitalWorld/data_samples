always found them a good medicine.
Our tittle girl, Hattie, was broubled with
Kidney Disease. The Doctor said sho
wns threatened with Dropsy. Nerjimbs:
and body wereall swollen andwe began
tothinkshe could notlive. Finally, we
decided to try ‘‘Fruit-a-tives”., She
began to show improvement after we had
given her afew tablets, "In ashort time,
the swelling had a)} gohe down and her
flesh began to look more natural. Now
sheis the Acaltitest one tn the family

lack, and the need of mon wis im-
perative, they formed what were
known 06 “Press gang crews.” A cap-
tain wauld enter a town or village,
got the mayor, magistrate end o few
other officlals together, then proceed
something like this:

“J'd like to get about a dozen of
able-bodied men here,” begins the cap-
tain.

“Very good,” responds the Mayor,
“we've somo We can spare. Now there's
Bob Skates, able-bodied, but won't
work more'n an average of two days
a week. Put bim down, Then Jack
Spratt beats his wife. Give hiry some
ren) fighting.”

‘Don't forget Ned Mathers con-
tnues the Magistrate, “he’s up befare
me every few days for fighting.”

“And Scad Smith,” chimes in a cop,
“he drinks his £arningy, and wite feeds
him.’ And Tobe Stubs depends mostly
on. stealing for his lMving.”

Thus they would go on till the draft
was made up, then round up the men.

Now it those in both city and coun-
try were rounded up, it has been es-
timated tliat we could aupply quite an
army cf such undesirables. In the
cities and towns ure loafers, gamblers,
drunkards, crooks,.and those who ne-
giect, abuse or desert their families.
In the country the moat common un-
desirables are thieves. Many through
shittiessness, tdieness, ¢@xtravagance,
or bad management neglect to provide
for the winter. Theso must have fuel
and food for themselves, also, they
usually haye live stock which must
starve or be fed. ‘Their usual way fs to
go about stealing rails, grain,. poul-
try, pitted vegetabdfes, or anything
within reach,

The ones whoa do this thieving are
well known: to those who are robbed,
but lt is a diMev)t mattor to prove in
many cases, But if a potition is sent
jn to thle Government to remove these
undesirables, the names of ai suspects
could be handed to the military tri-
bunafs, who wouid gather thom into a
unit and pack them off for overseas
service.

Of course most of them sre gun-shy.

or not too old to go out stealing, or
otherwise breaking te Jaw, j3 able to
