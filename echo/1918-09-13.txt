ment (Col. Napier) and the 52nd Regi-
ment (Sir John Colborne) to ‘ehurch
for service. The latter regiment took
part in the battle of Waterloo. Mr.

Kingston, and of late years has been
in charge of the Church of England
funds at Toronto. He is now retired
after a very busy life.

T is one of the anomalies of life
that the sources of our greatest
pleasures and greatest menns of
g00d, may also be sources. of |’

Milk is a case in point. Milk fs the
best source of life's greatest need—

tically all deaths, except. those due
to accident or old age,

Fortunately we have discovered
comparatively saimple methods of
combating the effects of what - aro
called pathogenic (disease-produc-
ing) bacteria, These may be stated
in a few short rules as follows:

1. Milk which {s consumed in a
raw condition must be drawn only
from cows which are healthy,

2. As soon as the milk is drawn
from the cow, tt should be cooled to
50 degrees or lower, and be kept at
that temperature until consumed.

3. All pails, strainers, dippers,
milk bottles, pitchers, ete.; which
come in contact with the milk, must
be thoroughly washed and preferably
steamed, or be rinsed after washing
{n a chloride solution, which bas been
found to be one of the best germi-
cides,

4, Milk should not be exposed to
the air any Jonger than absolutely
necessary, as this seeds the milk with
a fresh lot of germs,- This meang
the keeping of milk in a closed. ves-
sel and not Jm an open dish.

6. “Left over” milk from meals
should not be put into the general
supply, as this causes the whole lot
to spoll.

6. “Left over’? milk from the sick
room should be pasteurized or de-
stroyed, as it may spread disense.

7. Milk at all times and fn all
places should, be kept ‘clean’ and
“cool,”—Prof. H. H. Dean, Ontario
Agricultural College,

Stable for*partof the day. This mean:
Q good deal of extra labor cleaning
the stable, and keepirs the cows
clean, and under present jabor con-
ditions may not be practicable on
many farms. Howeyer, where there
is the necessary labor available and
particularly where cows are Tecelving

ble may well take place during the
day and the cowa: be Kept inside

stable dark.

Water Necessary for Comfort and
Milk Production,

Cows frequently ‘puffer from lack
of sufficient water,; As a boy, the
writer remembers 4riving cattle to
“Big Crick, in Brant County, during
dry spells, THE cows were nearly
famished when they Yeached~ the
“Crick” and would @rink until they
looked like burst! By the time

they reach home, after walking for Published under the Authority of
a mile-and-a-half over a dusty road, Minister of Finance

The
the cattle were neafly as thirsty as of
ever. 4

The only safe sgurce of a sure e
water slpply Ia a Qpep well,. driven :
or bored, and having:the water pump-
ed by windmill: or Other gources of
power, with a storage tank for. ewer- {
gencies. There fa ng part of Ontario
in which’ an abundance of water can-
not be obtained, if we go deep
enough to tap the hidden sources of
supply. ’

No matter how ‘it Is cbhtained, the
owner of dairy stock, more especial-
ly of cows ‘milking, must supply a
large amount vif water, else the stock ;
will suffer, Whiich means lessened 1
milk supply, andi small cheques from
the creamery, cheesery, condensery,
or city, dealer. Milk cOnsists of about
87% per cent. water, and this water
must come from the drink and feed
of the cow, A cow giving 100 Ibs.
(10 gallons) of milk daily, wilt drink
over 200 Ibs. (20 gallon#) of water
in a'day, Cowes giving-less milk will
drink in proportion. ‘Give the cows
plenty-of water. Young cattle, calves,
and hogs also need. plenty of clean
water in’ hot weather,

Fly Remedies, ;

There are several good fly réme-
dies om the market. Where there is
no time to make one, the purchase
of a patent fiy-killer or repellent, {a
advisable. » These, are usually applied:
daily, or twico a day with @ small
hand sprayer. ‘

A bothe-made remedy may consist
of one-half gallon Ozh oi), or any old
grease, one-half pint coal ofl, ‘and
four tiblespoonfuls of ¢rude car-
wbolic acid, cresol, ete. Mix thor-
oughly. This will be sufficient for
twenty-five cows and may be applied
with a brush of cloth. {f¢ there Us

several days, Milkers muat be care-
ful not to’ get this onthe hazids, |

Roguing ‘Potatoes,

The average yield of potatoes per
acre in the’ Province of Ontario for
the past thirty-six years has been
about 115 bushels. The yields vary
greatly. In 1917 there: were vari-
ations ‘In-.Ontario from twenty-five
or less up to seven hundred bushels
Der acre. People are realizing more
and more that for high yields of po-
tatoes conditions must tbe favorable,
It ds important to have good fertile
. | soll well cultivated and to plant a
liberal supply of seed of the bést
varietios at the proper time.  -Séed
potatoes somewhat immature” which
have been produced: in a cool cli-
mate, and which aro comparatively
free from disease, are apt to furnish
seed of high quality, Eyen under
these, conditions; it is well to care-
fully Inspect the seed before plant-
ing-and to thoroughly rogue the

one of the most effectual ways in
ridding the field of a number of the
potato diseases, This operation would:
,also insure the immediate. removal
of the weak and unthrifty plants
which are sure to produce undersl:-

go through their fields and remove
all plants which aro not true to type.

"Exercise the Breeding Stock.

Exorclso' js ebsential for all male
breeding stock. At certain seasons
of the-year it {8 an easy matter to
arrange for amplo exercise for tha
stallion, the. bull, the boar, or the
ram. At other times it 4s rather dif-
ficult and frequently little or, no
exercise is given, or if given too much
freedom occasionally, harm to
iro is the result,~

The bull should not be allowed to
run Idose in the pasture with the
cows. In the first place it ia « dan-
gerous custom, as it gives abundant
opportunity for thé bull to attack a
person, unawares or where escape is
dificult. Furtber, a record of the
date of breeding of the cowa cannot
be. kept and no herd can be handled}:

records, ©

SUNDAY MOTORING BANNED.

motorists of tis country to refrain
from motorhg on Sunday, September

more than 204.000 worth of gasoline

| Under the circum:
1 Controller appeals
to the people of Canada to exercise the
most rigid ecommy in the consump
tion of gasoline antil such time as the
pablic is officiall¥ notified that no far-
ther necessity etists for extraordin-
ary economy. Tals may be effected
im two directions. First by eliminating
extirely. all annev*SSary use of motor
cars. Sécondly bythe economical u:
and handling of g#soline.

It is likely tha‘ all patriotic citizens
will accept the request of the Fael
Controller in thé Proper spirit. but to
head off any slackers, the Attorney:
General of Ontario has ruled that sale
of gasoline Sundays is a contravention
of the Lord's Day Act. The Feel Con-
troller expects that the call for volun-
tary conservation will be 60 well ob-
served that it will not be necessary
to embody ‘the restrietions in formal]
regulations. Doctors, ambulances, fire
equipment. police and undertakers

oline, repair outfits employed by tele-

The object of banning the sale of

AN INTERESTING BIT OF
PELEE ISLAND HISTORY

 

Introduction of Grape Growing—Iis-
land Once Famed for Its Vine-
yards and Wine Making.

The selling out of the balance of the
Pelee Island Wine Company’s plant
last month marks’an epoch in the hia-
tory of Pelee Island. #

In 1866 Thaddeus Smith and W;
Williams, both Kentuckians, came to
Point au Pelee Island and bought 40
acres of land on one of the most beat-
tiful points of Pelee Island, after-
wards named; Sheridan's Point after
the celebrated’ American general who
in peaceful tlmes wis occasionally a
guest of the Pelee Club.

They bullt ‘a fine stone house with
rock-hewn cellar below, and planted
out the.-first Pelee [sland vineyard.

- The Broken
Tie

Gurdon Espey, ringmaster of SIl!-
ery’s Great Circus, flecked the ¢ar of
a water boy who Mad #tumbled over o
rope with the tp of his long-lished
whip. and gave the weehln o quarter

   

to mend his bawling. He cnught o
stake min drinking wat of a botile.
seized the offe ; vessel and
smashed It ngaliat a plank,

 

“You're discharged, Uppting

of the sawdnuat circle,

“Ought td have known better,” re
marked o hustler to the culprit. “He's
dead dowo on the bard driuk. They
say he goes ‘lear arqund a block to
keep from pnasing A gaioon, he hate
them so, Expey 18 @ queer one—vet
he’s~bad a history.” ‘.

Yes, Gurdon Espey had ao history,
and it had climaxed in making lilt
the odd wakeup of. humanity he was,
Strictness aad severity were strangely
mixed with the most generous of Sn-
stinets. And then he would become
angry If the remotest reference war
made to these wayward impulses,

“Oh, mister! can we speak no word
with you?” hailed the ringmaster us
he cnme outside of the big tent. und
Espey turned, with his habitual scat,
to be confronted by twelve boys rung
ing in age from eight to twelve yenrs;
their leader acting as spokesthin.

“What Is jt?” he Snapped out, al-

“We want to know If we can hire

master, “What for now?”

“Our circus.” ‘

Hed Espey. “And where may this cir-

means and were enthusiastic, and the
result was the finest vineyard at,the
time in Canada. The “Vin Villa Vine-
yards,” as they were named was the
show place of the islands After the
vineyards commenced bearing Messrs.
Smith, Williams & Co, sold their
grapes to.wine manufacturers at San-
dusky, Ohjo, but» finaily decided to go
into wine making themselves, and in
1871 made their first attempt at wine
making,

In, 1873 they had their first wine
ready for sale, Mr. Williams had
then retired from the firm, and
Thaddeus Smith became the sole pro-
prietor.

Canadian wine was then an un-
known quantity, even in Ontario, and
the wines sold principally yyere’ the
cheap wines of Spain. In 1873 Mr.
Smith had about a carload of wine
fully matured, and was desirous’ of
selling it. Not having confidence in
his own selling powers he staited out
the late D- F. B, McCormick-to sell
his stock, The doctor started out full
of confidence, taking in Windsor,
Chifitham and London, but at the week-
end returned with nothing to show but
his expenses.

A week or two later Mr. Smith de-
efded to sée what he could do, and
after canvassing Windsor, Chatham,
Londoh, Ingersoll and Woodstock,
without any better luck than. the roc-
tor, arrived at Brantford and luckily
for him called “on J. S$: Hamilton &
Co. J. S. Hamilton, the head of the
firm, examined Mr. Smith’s samplés
of wine and was so pleased with them
that he not only bought bfs, whole lot
of matured Wines, but ‘arranged ‘to
take his sale agency. This was the
beginning of many years of friendship
and business relation’ between the
two men. The island at ‘that time
was called Point au Pelee Island. Mr,
Hamilton started an extensive adver-
tising campaign, called the island
Pelee Island, and Pelea:Island wine
became known all over Canada. A few
yenrs later Edward and John Ward-
roper started a- vineyard, and when
they had wine fit for sale J. S. Hamil-
ton & Co. took their sale agency, The
vineyards on the {sland steadily {n-
creased, until in 1885 Mr. Smith and
Mr. Wardroper were unable to handle
the great quantity of grapes in their
cellars. This decided Mr. Hamilton
to form the Pelee Island Wine and.
Vineyards Co., Limited, and thé result
was the erection in,the summerof
1887 of a fine three-storey wine ‘house
on the west side of the-island. The
building was erected in time for the
1887 vintage and a large quantity. of
wine was made. . ~ 7

For over a acore of yoars’ the com-
pany did a Jarge business and grape
growing was the teading industry of
the {sland, but tobacco commenced to

“Down in a lot, next to Mra, Dan-

and with a certafn splice of pride. “You

Bo much, and It’s her birthday. and we

“She's a fairy!” piped up a little fel-
low of eight.

“No, ahe's just an angel!” supple
mented a companion.

“We've made a sawdust

the spokesman of the party. “We've
got quite a program. I swallow

saulta. Ned Bates walks n clothestine

stunts, so we want to hiré your clown
for about an hour, to make Zva lant
and feel good.”

“Do you happen to know how much
a clown costs?” interrogated the rire
master.

“No, sir, but we've got six dotjirs
and fifty cents among us. You sec, we
all get fifty cents from our parents to
come to your circus tonight, rx! poor
little Eva Cin't be moved this far, £0
we've put our money together to the
the clown, and give Eya a réal gooc

“Nothing colng.” growled Espey,
starting to pass on hia way, when out
of a side tent d6dged a folly-faced
lump of rotundity. ° ’

“Who says it?” rollicked the same,
“Sick girl, boy frienda getting, up a
show for the little lady? Whit time
doen this, greatest show on earth come
on the boards, kids?”

“Two o'clock, sir,”
spokesman of the group.

“Come? I wouldn't miss it for fifty:

continued the clown, waving a renssur-
ing hand to the ringmnster. “It don't
cost you anything. and the stunt will
be a famous advertisement for our own

two members of the circus
ing cornets, appeared on the scene,
and, keeping march time to the marck
they delivered, the clown's daughter,
all radiant with tulle and tinsel, drove
slawly into the ring, seated fh her
gilded chariot, white ribbon lines
guiding the two snowy ponies.

And then, the wonder of wonders for
Bya, into the ring bounded the clown.
Oh, but he was funny! and oh, the
rapturous delight of Eva and the out-
aide audience, as Napoleon Bonaparte
came upon the scene, the gifted, trick
mule who chased his master in a cir-
cle, toppled him over the ropes, threw
him off his back and danced about
him on his own hind feet!

Never was so much delight crowded
{nto the space of a single hour, and
the child wonder of the white ponies
came into the room where Eva was,

and klesed her, and presented her }

with a great overflowing bag of pea-
nuts, pop corn and candy, and the
clown made a speech to Eva's “actor”
friends, and the alr rang with the ac
clamations of the juvenile group.
“So you're back from your grand
philanthropic excursion, are you?”
hatled the ringmaster, as the clown
reappenred on the circus grounda.

“Yea, what's your interest, Espey?’
challenged the clown keenly, “Suy,
you're not by any’ menns the groff old
bear you pretend to be, and {f you had
seen all the good a little attention to
the poor and Yowly has worked out,
you'd come out of that clo#e shell of,
yours. Look here, I've given a pass
to that odd dozen amateur actors for
tomorrow night.. See that it's hon-
ored, will you?”

“What about the six dollars and fifty
cents? Of course you got that.”

“Sure I did,” acknowledged the open-
hearted clown frankly, “and added as
much more to it, and donated, the
whole of it to buy an invalid chair for
the Ilttle mise,”*and then he was quite
amazed at the persistency of the ring-
master. in betraying on Interest In de-
toils of the Incident of the’ afternoon,
even to the location of the widow's
home. f

At dusk that evening Gurdon Espey
left, the circus grounds after carefully
plitcing a bank note 1 an envelope. He
sought out the scene of the amateur
circus of the afternoon and the home
of Mrs. Daniels adjoining, He wns
almost stealthy as he advanced up the
garden path. The front door was
ciosed, but Heht streamed ‘broadly
across the middle of the porch, al-
though !t was in shadow.

Espey crept up the steps on tip toe.
He stooped: down, drew out the en-
velope and attempted to punh ft under
the door, but this set so closely shut
tht tesinterstices would not admit
the envelope. -

“What Is it, please?” spoke a voice
at the shadowed end of the porch
startling Expey quite, nnd straining
his. vision, he made out feminine
form rising from © chair.

“I fancy I am detected!” and he half
laughed In an embarrnssed way. “T

We are all so interested In that little

“Gurdon!” died upon the Nps ofthe
woman, and she wavered and wis
forced to stendy herself by grasping
the.porch rail.

“alice!” uttered the man, and the
habitual cynical expression left his
face, and the glowing eyes told of a
new soul. aroused.

She shrank back.’ It was under the
memory of- five’ years previous when
she had fled from this man as from o
pestilence, for. soul and body were
given dver to drink until she had
feared for her life. She had hidden
away from him and now—he had found
her.

“Alice!” be sald, his tones tremu-
lous, but mot uncertain, “since the day
of your absence find that of your dear
little one awakened me toxa realiza-
tion of my utter’ unworthiness, no drop
of liquor has passed my lips.”

“Our little one,” she corrected him,

“May I come back?” he added, with

pa longing glance through the window:

at a little white-robed* form [ying on
a trundle cot.

Her hands clasped, her eyes were
suffused, her care-worn, but still beau-
tiful face looked up to him trustingly,
hopeful, toogingly. ~

“Oh, Gurdon!” she sobbed, “will you
come back to us?”
