standing that the terms would be sea-
sonable enough to be acceptable to

where you will find on display one of the largest and finest assortments of high grade

PIANOS, PLAYER PIANOS and GRAND PIANOS .

that we have ever shown in the City of Windsor.

Remember this is the only One Price Piano Store in Windsor and we do not have any fake summer resort sale of cheap low grade pianos or try to make believe that we give you
$75 to $100 off to allow us to put your name_on one of the fait pianos. Beware of any so-called salesman who makes you this proposition.

A Few of the Many Reasons Why the Heintzman & Co. Piano Should Be Your Choice

97 per cent. of the Grand Pianos sold in Essex County in the last thirteen years are Heintzman & Co.

Heintzman & Co. Pianos have taken more Gold, Silver, B i i i
Rn caiad ni nod COHORT en ' , Bronze Medals, First Prizes and Diplomas than all

There are more Heintzman & Co. Pianos used in colleges, convents, conservatories, than. all others’combined.
Heintzman & Co. are the oldest and largest manufacturers of high grade pianos in Canada. Over ‘70,000 in use”

e

We have some very rare bargains in used pianos, taken in exchange on Heintzinan & Co. pianos. Some that are
as good as new at about half price? Very easy terms arranged during the Fair.

Store open evenings till 9 p. m. If you can’t call write for booklet of special bargains which will be mailed free

The West Dyke road is full of ruts
and pitch-holes and it is a source of
annoyance to motor drivers, bat the
council has been unpble to engage
men to repair the roads this year, in
spite of the fact that they offered “the
highest kind of wages and have over
five hundred dollars to the credit of
the various road divisions, by the levy
of only twenty-five, cents a day tax.
The said fund has accumulated -but
it cannot be put back where it be-
longs unless more help {s available.

Care of Ewes After Weaning. |

- In order to avoid udder trouble
salary’o€ | it ig necessary to keep a close watch
of the ewes for a few days after they
are separated from the lambs. Not
a few cases of defective udders caa
be traced to. the want of a little care
in this respect. Milk out just
gnough to. keep the udder soft-the
day after-the lambs have been wean-
ed: After two days’ time they are ,
again milked out, Some ewes do
not need any-more attention after
the second milking. Such ewes may
be marked to jndieate that they are | 209
dry. Three more days should elapse | 920,
‘before the next milking is dohe and 324
this method followed unfil it-is cer- | 75, °¢
tain the entire flock 1s safe. In con- 228,
junction with the method outlined | 230.
above the ewes should be separated | 242, 9
home distance from the lambs, and loga 2
be on scant pastures-until all are per- | ps ‘
fectly dry. This is a good time to 1 248
go over the flock and cu!! out all un- |249
desirable members. Non-producers | 955
and those with broken mouths and | 967
poor udders should not be retained: | >
‘A. good deal of the success of the | 275,
subsequent lamb crop will depend
upon the treatment the ewes receive
from time of weaning until after they
are bred. They should have good
pastures and be given an opportunity
of! puttingron flesh. This is what 1
conimonly talled “flushing.” Nothing
is better for this purpose than rape
pesture. It {s usually from six-weeks
{0 two months from date of sowing
that rape is ready for pasture, If
rape pastdre {s not available new
beeding or second crop of clover will»
serve fairly well. Stock should not
be turned on rape or fresh clover for
the: first time when’ the leaves are
wet from rain or even dew, ip order
to avoid trouble from bloating.—

THE BUSINESS WOMAN

To-day more than ever before, is
woman's opportunity. Many new ,0c-
cupations aré*now opened to fer,
which, before the war, she was deem-
ed unfitted to fill.; And the truth to
tell she has riser to the opportunity,
and™now shares many business re-
sponsibilities in former times confined
to men. But, as women are subject to
more frequent fluctuations of health
than men, miany will be handicapped
early, {f they regard their health re
quirements too lightly.

The nervous strain, Jong hours and
pro‘onged. mental or physical fatigue
thin th® blood and weaken the nerves
Such conditions as women are how
called upon to™undergo can only be
endured by a full-blooded conat‘tution.
This is true for men as for ‘woren,
only weaker women
The women worker, if any line, re-
|quires her blood-replenished- frequent:
ly. She needs new, rich.blood to keep
her health under the trying condi-
tong of business life, and to fortify
her Bystem against the effects of over-
work. This applies also to the wo-
man in the home, who ,perhaps, has
more worries and anxiety than usual.
So let all girls and women take heed
and renew their blood promptly at the
first appearance of pallor, Iack of ap-
petite, headache or backache. This
can be best and most effeetively ac-
complished by taking Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills which make new, rich blood
And thus help womankind so Perfectly.
No woman need fear failure of health
if they take these pills océasionally
to keep them well, or give them a fair

find themselves ron

You can get Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
through any medicine dealer or by
mail at 60 cents
for $2.60 from The Dr. ¥

Mrs. Scoley Lidwill, of Poleé Island,
was Overjoyed the other day to re-
ceive the following letter from her
son Edward, who is in France with
the American Expedilionary Forces;
August 4th, 1918.

My Dearest Mother and Dad,—Just
a few lines to let you know that I
going on well and hope you aré the
same. The longer I stay over here
the better I like it, so don't worry
about us boys. We'll all be back
home again soon. Bob is not far from
where I am although I haven't seen
him yet, but I met a yonug fellow
from the 6th Canadian Battalion and
he safd the 4th Battalion wasn't far
from them. He didn’t know what
town they were in, but just as soon as
I can find out what town he is in
I'll be up to see bim, and I sure would
like to see Bob. It has been nearly
four years since I've seen him. I just
bad a letter from Lillian. She snid
Claire was on his way over. 1 hope
I have a chance to see him, too. I
suppose Billy will be over soon. Well,
Mother, the more that come, the
sooner the war will be over. I don't
think it will ast much longer. They
got bim on his last legs right now.
The Americans suro do kill them off
when they go over the top. The British
nll say that the U. S. boys are. some
