Compare “Comfort” with any
other soap—“Comfort” stands
the test. That’sa big claim to
make, but our 25'year’s record
of the largest sale of any soap-in
Canada is the best proof of its

truth. Why experiment? You
know “Comfort”.

AFTER THE TOBACCO TRUST.

A man very prominent In Univers-
{ty and Labor circles in Toronto
claims there is a movement on foot,
jeaded by same of the college frater-
nad organizations there, to organize a
world-wide strike against the exorbit-
ant prices now charged by the tobac-
co trusts in Europe and in America
for their goods, whether it be cigars,
chewing tobacco, smoking tobacco or
cigarettes. While the war tax on to-
bacco has gone up in all countrie, to-
bacco has been increased in price to
the consumer two or three times the
amount of the war tax ‘without any
justifiable reason therefor, Raw _to-
bacco js cheaper, but labor is higher.
An appeal to supperk the. strike, it is
sald, is also to be made to all sovdiers
and sailors who have served in the
great war, and also to all secret socie-
ty organizations; and that-while {ft
may be some time yet before the
thing will be effective, it will be very
sweeping Jn its results. It will bring
the tobacco trusts to thelr knees in
one day.

Ventilate the Cellar,

A well-drained. Garth floor is more
desirable for a root cellar than one
of cement or brick. A certain amount
of, mejsture is needed to keep roois
and tubers in best condition, but
should not be. more than’can be kept
in cheek by_thorough ventilation ‘of
the cellar. To ensure good distribu-
tion of fresh air in the cellar a pipe
several inches,in dianfeter may be
carrlad from abwindow to.the back
of the ¢gllar, near, the ground, the
outer end”of the pipe being placed in
the space made by removing a small-
sized wind@w pane,” This permits of

lation will be seevired In very cold
weather both intake ‘ind outlet may

In putting vegotables.dirétt into
winter storage from the field, it is
sometimes knpossible to remove all
injured or rotten parts and for this
Reason frequent culling during the
storage season js necessary to pre-
vent the spread, ofydisease. wThis is

vespecially, frue of potatpes, while a

vegetable that must be very carefully
leoked after is celery, especially df
any disease of the stalks or Yeaves
is present at digging time. In guch
gase. the affectéd Néuds>should be
stored away frédm the sound ones and
should be wsed during the fall.

material from too much Heht and

Milking Machine Saves Labor.

The milking machine will take the
grind out of the work in dairying, To
the looker-on hand milking appears
to be an easy job, hut it decidedly is
not, tg sit for one or two hours twice
a day in a cranrpéd and unnatural
position with the museles ured and
aching is anything but casy. The
mechanical milker does away with
all this. It is but the work of a mo-
mentto start the machine, attach the
teat-cups, and when finished tore
move and change to another cow, and
so on down the Hne,

One man with’ a dotible unit-

milker can milk twenty cows in an
hour, and do the stripping besides.
It would take a fairly good steady
man to mil ten cows in an hour if
the milking were done by hand; so
here {5 a saving of an hour twice a
day. Oounting 300 days as a year,
er an average lactation period, two
hours a°day for.30@ dnys, is 600
hours. Six Hundred hourm divided
Into days of ten hours each means
60 days, which at the present mo-
ment, when timo counts for so much,
is too heavy a Joss to be regarded

mtown who patronized Miss Kel-
jogg that when she cashed In her old
machine a few years before and got a
new one she had threatened to get a
“single threader,” but loud had been
the objections. Her patrons didn't
want to run the risk of having seams
come undone in church or at soclables,
as they had heard of their doing when
sewed In thnt careless manner.

The doctor had never called on Mar-
faret before except professionally once
or twice, and this was not exactly a
socin) call. He hat been designated
by the loce! authorities as one of-fhose
to help with the Thrift stamp canvass
and be had, much ns he disliked to do
It, to find out from ench person on the
street just how much he or she would
invest in Thrift stamps before the first
of the next year. ;

Margaret didn't hesitate in explatln-
{ng so long us she might had she not

‘heard the doctor’s confidences tivo
months before. Her excuses were
much the same. Farnamtown was
slower pny than ever and thrend and
findings were getting higher every day.
What if she did charge a little more
to cover the-increase? If the ladies
didn't poy ‘till year after next that
really didn't help. So except perhaps
for one or two stamps she could make
no promise. She would like to dis-
pense with her one apprentice and
save her small wage, but she was an
odd little girl—daughter of a poor
widow—and If Margaret didn't employ
her goodness knows who would; and
then what would become of her?

If there were only something she
could do to earn a little’ extra every
once In a while—she had heard of peo-
ple doing that. So had the doctor and
he, too, wished that {n Farnamtown he
might find some simple task to per-
form by which he might earn the Jit-
tle necessary to make his small sub-
scription to government. loans and
Thrift stamps.

Now they had both told each other
their little predicament and somehow
they felt that there was sombthing be
tween them that did not exist between

pleasurably and then In a twinkling

That was.how It began. The doctor
sald he had some cherries golng to
waste on his place. He couldn't sell
them and he cquldn’t ent them all. He
smacked his lips over the sample and
said he could well afford to pay a lt-
tle to have his cherries converted {nto
food for next winter... And that was
how Miss Margaret made arrangements
to earn her bit toward buying Thrift
stamps. It was very little, but ‘the |
