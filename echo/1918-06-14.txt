“you.aro very kind, count,” protest-
ed Mrs. Raymond, withdrawing her
hand and pleking up a alk covered
jewel box, “but, really, I cannot accept

“Not a8 a souvenir of those delight-

handsome Italian, “I.am sure your

band on Dick Raymond's broad shoul-

Jowship into the young American's
honest eyes.

Dick Raymond smiled rather doubt

, there was 4 delightful view of tho
lovely Arn flowing townrd the distant [/

sea and the hills that encirele the city
of Florence,

To the Men walking on the terrace
the view was a familiarone, but never
urégome. Sorfo had been born in Tus-
cony, and he loved it Dick Raymond

it because of {ts unchanging beauty.

Iu the meantime Etbel Raymond sat

When Count Soro saw Lisette, Tes-

tino stafiding 1n tho Mhgary toying with

the enameled bracelet his face went

suddeily pale and his greeting to her

was Shortencd to utter a whispered
word of protest.

“guch gaudy trinkets do not become

your pale dignity, my queen,” he whis-

pered hurriedly. “Put {t aside, Lisetta,
It felt Juck. It attracts the evil eye.
It is accursed.” He ghuddered os he

caught bimself up sharply.

Ethel’s clear yolce was spenking as
they moved toward the dining room.
“Count Sorlo says that the bracelet

{fg a charm, that It will avert the evil
eye amd that ft will bring mé good
luck?” x

Dick Raymond latghed genially, but

the dark eyes of Lisetta met the black
glance of Sorio. There was a puzzled
questioning In her glance and a min-
gling of fear and annoyance in bis.

Lisetitn went back to the drawing

room after her handkerchief and when
she returned there was a look of
amusement In her cool glanco a3 it
crossed ‘that of ber lover,

Tho meal progressed slowly. The

Raymonds' |had a good cook in the per-
son of Marvgbarita, the grandmother of
Césnre, and the wine of the country
Awas «excellent.

Liisetta was sparkling with gayety,
amd the connt’s dark eyes often sought
hers across the low arrangement of
flowers on the table, and the Ray-
monds realized that very soon would
the flery Italian deciimre bis love for
the widow. Ne

Suddenly Lisetta Jiffted one white
hand to adjust the iose Ethel! bad
ticked in her jet Hlacikk hair. As she
did so her three cOmpanions saw for
the first time that she wms wearing the
enameled bracelet.

Lisetta tossed ber hemd and smiled
{mpudently at Etbel.

“See, carissima, Iam wemring your
bauble while I may!”

“It. becomes you rarely, madame,”
laughed her hostess.

Sorio's face was’ghasifly pale. Twice
his lips’ parted as {ft to give utterance
to some protest, but tliey closed, as it
setrocy demanded silenico at any price.
At last he could contain himself no

longer. ;

“Mndopna!” ho gasped, rising and
renching across the tabilo at Lisetta’s
arm. “Take It off,card milny It—means
—death!” He half whispered the last ‘

words and sank back fn bjs seat a3

Dick Raymond jumped up) and held a

glass of wine)to Lisetta’s Wale lips,

Mme, Teéstino had utfrered no sud-
den cry of anguish andi!tier bead droop-
ed slowly. down until {ft rested on one
shoulder, :

“Phe pain, the paln! she muttered
before she lost consclousnicss.

Dick Raymond dashed around the
table and caught the shrinking Soric
by the shoulder. “What bois happened,
you coward?” be demanded. “What {s
there about that bracelet tha causes

sight of her weiring {t upon her: ‘arm

room like lightning Sashes. He had

That was an eventful night in the
Villa Rosario, The déctor remiained un-
til morning ond administered antidotes
for the deadly poison which had been
injected. into Lisetta’s veins through
the medium of the poisoned bracelet.

It was perhaps punishment enough
for bis Myrerous heart that he for-

While ploughing on his farm near

every respect and which had. appar-
ently been buried within a very re-
cent time. The body was wroaped
in cptton and newspapers. which the older sort, known ae

Every F armer N eeds a Ford

HE Motor Car is a greater convenience to the average
\ farmer than the telephone, the rural mail or even the

grain binder. :
The binder which is considered as a very useful implement
is’rarely used more than a few days during the entire year.
The rest of the time it stands idle, taking up space, while
the automobile is available for use throughout all seasons,
and both day and night.’

It is ever ready to run down the lane to the back field or the
pasture with a parcel or a: message, or take you and your
family to town for shopping purposes—or on an errand to
the neighbors, -

The motor car is called upon whenever anything is wanted
in a hurry. It is the most useful implement or convenience
for the farm. It helps you conserve your energies and time
for productive work and enables you and your family to
accomplish more with less energy. You surely feel the need
of a Ford. Why not order one today?

All prices eubject to war tax charges, except trucks and chasete

About fourteen miles from Liverpool
on the River Dee stands the city of
Chester, which was founded by the
Romans. It is surrounded by a high
wall of old masonry, and contains the
celebrated “Rows of Chester,” which
are arched passageways higher than
the street, through which the sidewalks
run, There are also many other pe-
cular features in this sleepy, antique
and very interesting city. -

One 6f the historic legends of old
Chester is an amusing story relating to
cats, Mary Hall Leonard writésin Our
Dumb Animals.

When Napoleon was defeated by the
English nt Waterloo, in 1815, he was
sentenced to exile at the Island of St.
Helena, where he -findlly died, May 15,
1821. Just before the ex-emperor and
his escort were embarked at Plymouth
—so the story runs—a curious hand-
Dill was circulated up and down the
old Rows of Chester, It stated, In cf-
fect, that the Island of St. Helena had
been found to be dreadfully infested
with rats; that his majesty’s ministers
had determined that {t should be forth-
with cleared/ of thése obnoxious ant-
mifile; and that an agent had been ap-
pointed to purchase such cats and kit-
tens a8 could be secured for this pur-
pose. All citizens who had eats that
they were willing to sell were invited
to bring them to the market place,
whére the purchase would be made.

town of: Chester presented o curious

It is usually safe to cut after a
rain when the weather appears to
have cleared. Red clover should be
cut when about one-third of the
heads have turned brown. Tho ted-
der should then be used until: the
crop is dry/enough to rake—a period
which will vary according to the
welght of the cutting, the weather
and the amount of sap in the stalk.
While it is possible to make slightly.
better hay by cocking up, this will be
a practice of doubtful value this year

The Food Board bellewes that the
expense of enforcing compulsory
rationing upon a wide nattered
population In the Dominion would not
be justified by the amount of conser-
