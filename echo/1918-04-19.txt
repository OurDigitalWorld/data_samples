fish In the Province of Ontario during
the war, His sole concern was lest
the Government should defeat the
very aim it had in view by penalizing
the fishermen and making it almost
impossible for them to carry on a
profitable business. The Government
had quoted 8c a th, for trout and
whitefish, the fishermen to supply the
boxes and ice for shipping purposes.
In his speech Mr, Bowman maintain-
ed that this price would not give tho
fishermen a sufficient margin to make
the business profitable, after allowing
for the very heavy depreciation of
plant which was entailed jn this line
of business

Mr. Proudfoot, the Liberal leader,
although-supporting the Government's
program, urged upon the Minister the
necessity of engaging expert assist-
ance jn carrying out the scheme, ow-

the Government is going to utilize

WOULD EXTEND FARM DRAINAGE

Ontario Department of Agriculture
Lending: Encouragement
to Scheme.

Drainage systems on Ontario farms
have proved such a boon to agricul-
ture in recent years, that the Depart-
ment of Agriculture is taking another
forward step and extending this
branch of its work. The Province {is
to be divided into four zones, with
qualified men in charge of each one,
who wil study soil conditions; make
Surveys, and. generally do everything
possible to assfst the farmers in ex-
tending this most important work.

A branch of the Ontario Agricul
tural College—has devoted consider-

able time in the past encouraging
drainage throughout the Province.
They have had a staff of men who,
in ‘response to applications from far-
mers, surveyed the farm fields and
supplied information as* to the quan-
tity and size of tlle required. The
districts into which the Province has
now been divided are arranged with
iwiew to having the sofl as near
alike in each one as possible. The
men in charge will] study the soi! and
drainage problems of their particu-
lar districts, make surveys and gen-
erally assist the farmers in putting
in drains. Under th® system that
hag been In force up until this time
the men. were only employed from
Maly 1st ‘until september ist. Now
the men will be employed the year
round, and much, good: {s expected to

Two men remain to be appointed for

age ordered from the Southern States
by Canadian dealers is now 300,000
bushela, orders totalling this amount

jihoving been repeated to the United

Some doubt has been expressed of
late as to the possibility of the seed
corn supply being sufficient, but in
view of the amount already ordered
and. the fact that orders are continu«

Ing to go through in big numbers,

daily, the officials of the seed branch
are satisfied that the “supply will be
sufficient for all growers of ensilage
corn in Canada, and should be obtain-
able at a price of from $4.50 to $4.75
per bushel,

Since tho export of seed corn

In the Spring Most People Need a
Tonic Medicine.

One of the surest signs that the
blood is out of order is the pimples,
unsightly eruptions and eczema that
come frequently with the change
from winter to'spring. These prove
that the long indoor life of winter
has had ita effect upon the — blood,
and that a tonic medicine is needed
to put ft right. Indeed there are few
people who do not need a_ tonic at
this season: Bad blood does not
merely show itself in disfiguring erup-
tions. To.thisopame condition is due
attacks of rheumatism and lumbago;
the sharp stabbing pains of sciatica
and neuralgia, poor appetite and a
desire to avoid-exertion. You cannot
cure these troubles by the use of pur-
gative medicines—you need a_ tonic,
and a tonic only and among all
medicines there is none can equal Dr,
Williams’ Pink Pills for their tonic,
life-giving, nerve-restoring powers.
Every dose of this medicine makes
new, rich blood which drives out im-
Durities, stimulates every organ and
brings a. feeling of new health and
energy to weak, tired; ailing men,
women and children. If you are out
of sorts give this medicine a_ trial
and see how quickly it will restore
the appetite, revive drooping spirits,
and fill your veins with new, health-
giving blood. :

You can-get these pills from any
medicine dealer or by mail at 50

FARM VALUES,

Some interesting figures concerning
the Agricultural Industry of Canada
ure supplied by the Dominion Statisti-
clan. The avorage value of farm
lands, improved and unimproved, to-
gether with all buildings that may be
on them, is approximately $44 an
acre, a8 compared with $41 in 1916.
The Ontario average is $55.3 an acre.

The total value of live stock excels
a billion dollars. Horses account for
$479,123,000, milch cows are figured
at $274,081,000, other cattle $270,595,-
000, sheep $35,°76,000, and swine $92,-
$86,000. ‘There has been a distinct
increase in the number of animals
kept, as we)l as a sharp advance in
prices. The total number of cattle
and horses in-June, 1916, was 6,594,-
151, a year later it was 7,920,940.
Swine Increased from 3,474,840 to
8,619,382. ibaa 1x isa

With” this increase in assets, the
farmer has been forced to meet some
increase in abilities, For example
the average wage paid to farm labor-
ers is $610.60 with board, as compared
with $336.29 in 1909. It is by no means
clear that the growing «Itnbility- has
kept pace with the ‘increase In assets:

FARMERS BETTER OFF.

When complaints are heard about
the high cost of living farmers decline
to accept the blame, claiming they
have to “pay more for everything”
and must charro more for their pro-
duce. This is not borne out by an
examination of the facts. The far-
mer was better off last year than he
was in 1914, before the profiteers took
advantage of the war and sent H. C.
L. on his skyward journey. Statistics
prepared by Government experts in
Washington -show that in the case of
90 commodities the farmers’ wheat
Money in 1917 brought more than in
1914. Here is a comparative table of
what the money fram one aere of
wheat would purchase in various com-
modities taken at random:

Farming is becoming the most-re-
munerative occupation in Canada and

next ten years {ft vjll be Bréeat to
“plough and séw, roap and mow, and

FARMERS’ EXEMPTIONS

ARE REALLY LICENSES

Applications for Extension Should be
Sent in Before Expiry,

The attention of farmers recelying

service until @ fixed date is directed
to certain principles which have been
laid down by the Central. Anpenal
Judre-at Ottawa, which “apply to all
exempted men in this ciass,

The need for troops cannot: be éx-
aggerated. On the other hand, the
necessity for maintaining food pro-
duction is likewise Pressing, The ex-
emption granted farmers is granted
solely because of the conviction tat
they are, or lay be, more useftil in
food production than ag troops at the
front, ‘ i

Such exemptions are really in the
nature of licenges, and on thecondi-
tion that the efforts.of the Person ex-
empted for the purpose of assisting in
food production ’are such as to justity
the granting of exemption. <All such
exemptions are for a fixed period,
tually unti! June Ist or July 1st, but
in some cases until Nivember Ist, ”
In all’such cases the person exempt-
ed-has the privilege of applying for
an extension of the exeraption period,
when it ought to be showh what ef-
forts ‘the applicant has made and ig
undertaking for the greatest produc-
tion possible,

The application for exténsion should
be sent to the registrar at least two
Weeks before tho date fixed; accom-
panied with a statement showing the

the number of acres in grain (oats,
