Still Going Strong for Gold
Crowns—Capt. Rutherford Raised
to Rank of Major.

 

A qufat smile of gatisfaction foraluty
well performed may be noticed on the
countenance of every Amherstburg cit-
jzen who in any way contributed to the
glorious achievement of winning the
Victory Loan Honor Flag, for being
the first municipality in Essex county
to.“go over the top” with Ita allot-
ment.
committees for the past week that the
quota would be reached and every ef-
fort was made to hasten the time so}
that this old historic town might take
its place at the head of the list in
the county for Victory Loan bond pur-
chases a8 sho has in number of sol-
diers sent overseas, patriotic work of
all kinds and industrial development.
It couldn't have been done without ‘co-
operation, which was Very much in
evidence; a receptive and patriotic
people; » intejlgant organization, un-
selfishly. directed; ‘fine educatfonal
work’ among the many employees of
the Brunner, Mond; “pep” among the
canvassers, and eyeryone considering
his Tesponsibility . as an individual
salesman. When that spirit gets
abroad, nothing oan stop its. steam
roller progress, The result was a real
Victory Loan in Amberstburg, .and
the winning of thedonor Fling. _

It. appeared during the progress of
the campaign that the harder Amherst-
burg worked, the more willing the
Central Committee was to pile work
on us. Our, quota, first announced at
$59,000, was raised first day; then
$70,000 was set as the mark and passed.
and, later the committee aald it spould
have been $125,000, which didn’t even
cause the quiver of an eyelash.” The
machine waa {in perfect working con-
dition and ‘rambled right*along, until
Tuésday night a message was wired
Brigadier-General McGregor: “Over
the top, still going atrong.”

Wednesday a committee composed
of A, L. Campbell, W. T. Wilkinsan,
W. S. Falls and C. A. Cifddy, motored
fo Windsor bringing with them ‘the
credentiala and corrected figures con-
taining the fine sim of $149,000. The
reception they recelyed at the, Border
Chamber of Commerce and Victory
Loan committee roomg was historic,
Rutherford, who’ has been east
on a business trip, met them there,
and the delegation ‘was warmly con-
sratulated on the town’s great vic:
tory. Capti Rutherford was promoted
to the rank of Major on the fiéid, and
the flag prosented to him, by Brigad{er-
General MeGregor. Major Rutherford
and the members of the delegation re-
plied in short addresses, which were
interspersed with yells and songs led
by the inimitable Repaid Bros. and
enthusiajm ran to fever heats The
biggest “business men of Windsor
preased forward to tender their con-
gfatulations and shake hands with
Ambherstburg’s represéntatives.

Lator in the afternoon the commit-
tee brought the fing here, first exhibit-
ing it at the Bo M., then hanging, it
inithe front of the Central Committee
rooms.as an incentive f6r all to con-
tinue in the good work unfil the ever-

ANOTHER AMHERSTBURG SOL-
DIER FALLS,

 

Once againethe large Union Jack of
Fort Malden Chapter, I.°O. D. E,, is
floating lialf mast for an Amherstburg
boy who has fallen in battle. Once
again another Ambierstburg home is
stricken with grief, because their eld-
est born lias pald the supreme sacrifice
in this cruel war, which seems at Ifst
tobe drawing to a close. Monday
noon, Mrs. David Brown, Apaley street,
recolved one of those messages fraught
with so much sdfrow, telling her that
thelr son) Ernest David, has been of-|
ficially reported “killed ip action” on}
October 11th. “Deeply ‘regret to in-
form you”; wiifch prefaced, the mes-
sage, has ceased to contain ‘ny solace
for Amherstburg mothers, so many,of
whom are fated never to sec their
boys again; evemJtf they can hold up
their heads witl® pride because of
the deedsof héroism that these young
men have performed.

Private Brown enlisted at Amherst-
burg fn the local division ofthe Essex
County 99th Battalion, and went over-
seas in May, 1916. He soon, after-
wards was transférred to a battalion
whichs went to France and Into. ac-
tion. He was wounded at Vimy Ridge
and spent a year in England convales-
cing. He-had been on the’firing line
again threo. months when he was kill-
ed. Private Brown was ‘a cheerful,
buoyant letter-writer and his misasives
home often appeared in The Echo. It
was a doubly sad fate. for death fo
overtake him when Peace and Home—
all that he held dear—seems so near
at hand. .He. was only twenty-two
years of age last.June and was born
in Amherstburg. being the eldest son
of Mr. and Mrs. Brown. He passed
through Publié school Were and spent
some years In the employ of D.J: Bar-|
ron, when the latter conducted a gro-
cery store. He is survived by his par-
ents, two sisters, Ruth, of=the Bell,
telephone staff, and Loma, and Cires 2
brothers, Russell. Cecil and Stanley, of

pathy of the town in their bereave- i
