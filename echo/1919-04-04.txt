AMHERSTBURG WATER PURE.

 

“Dr. T. J- Park, Medical OMicer of |

Health, received on Monday a report
on the samples of Amherstburg drink-
{ng water sent by him last week to the
laboratories of the Provincial Board
of Health for an;analysis. Samples
were taken from three “places in
town—the upper end of Sandwich
street, corner Gore and Dalhousie
streets, and John Grant's store, cor
ner Gore and Seymore streets. For
the first time in e history of bac-
terlological test of Ambherstburg’s
water supply, no intestinal germs were
found, which means that the water is
nbsolutely safe for drinking purposes.
This {s all.the more gratifying since
the test, was made before the hy-
drants were flushed sand the dead
ends blown off. It is certainly worth
while to be able to advertise far and
wide «that Amherstburg has a pure
domestic water supply and ought to
be a strong factor in attracting {n-
dustrial plants to locate here in the

future, “The Brunner, Mond _ purifica-

It is expected that unless “there are

THE RISE OF BOHEMIA) sciso,muck to Bemis dor sc aa,

NATION WAS RULED BY RE-
ACTIONARY AUSTRIA.

Txech Love of Freedom Was Appar-
ent for Many Years Before Great
War, Bat lt Expanded and Burst
the Bonds When Teuton Allianve
Went to Pieces Last Year and
“Ramshackle Empire” Collapsed.

EFORE the war, the actual
jruling powers of Austro-Hun-
gary were in a decided minor- |
ity. But though the Slavs were |
superior in numbers, they exercised
no rule butsuffered undervarious dis-
abilities, political, social and” other-
wise, Apparently, however, they had
only to combine thelr forces and to
make common-cause against the Ger-
man and the Hungarian, in order to
win a measure of political freedom
and their rightful standing among
the nations of Europe, For the
Bohemians and the Serbo-Croats,
this atep seemed to be a natural one, |
as both could Jay claim to distinctive
nationality and to historic rights, as
well as to a degree of political organ-

ization and the tradition of a—per-
aistent policy of resistance to Tes-
tonic aggression.

But there were several well-defined ;
reasons why any attempt to assert
Slavic historie rights might not have
been attended with success. In the
first place, the Slavs within the em-
pire could not make common cause,
for the simple reason that many of
them were merely scattered frag-
ments of races, or formed detached
portions of ancient kingdoms which
had been conquered or annexed by
an atien people. For centuries, the
Hapsburgs had maintained their
power by a subtle and well-recog-
nized policy of division. All the time,
the Slave were being permeated and
infiltrated with German thought, lan-
guage and policy, from which there
was no effective escapé. Bohemia,
the most powerful of the Slay coun-
tries, was no exception to the rule,

The Germanization to which Bo-
emia was long subjected was such
that the preservation of her nation-
ality and her strongly marked racia)
characteristics is nothing less than
remarkable under the circumstances.
She was made an Integral part of the
Holy Roman Empire; indeed Prague
was at one time the capital of that
empire of the German emperors; and
German influences, German language
and literature, and German institu-
tions threatened complfetefy to- ab-
sorb the Tzechs. But thevallensmas-
ter was never able wholly to assimi-
late the race, and the, struggle
against Teutonizatlon had the one
supreme effect that It proved for the
Bohemians 4 pérpetual impulse to-
ward a renascence of Bohemian
natural life and Jiterature.. It is well
it was sop There came a time when
the Germanization of Bohemia had
reached such a stage that the Bo-
hemian language fell practically into
desuetude.

The literary revival marked by the
work of John Huss purified Bohem-
jan from Latinisms, and asserted the
language as a living entity. Jt was
placed at once on a new footing as a
cultivated tongue, and in the early
part of the nineteenth century, when
the. troubling. -of . the political
waters throughout Europe sent cur~
rents of feeling .to. Bohemia, the
Tzechs set about 4” earnest> firmly
to establish their language and liter-
ature in the schools aad universities.
It js» said, however, that one of a
number of Tzech patriots and sav-
ants who met together at the time,
in a coffee house in Prague, excliiim-
ed? “I¢ thfs roof were.to fall in,
Tzech Literature would perish with
us.” To such a pass Had the Bo-
hemian cause fallen! j

When the war broke otif, it tap-
pily found the Tzech language en-
joying equal rights with Gefman in
the sthools, In Prague, 30 much had
the language progressed that one
could nardly get an answer to 2 ques-
tion in German., Germain influence
has been, in fact, @ decfining factor
im Bobemian.development ever since
the federation of the Germanic
states excluded the territories of the
House of Hapsburg, TheTzech#form
70 per cént. vof, the population .of
their country, and an enthusiasm for
Tzech ideals has long been aroused
among the educated and upper
classes, as well as among the people
generally.

Hence the resistance of the Tzechs
to the tyranny of Austrian’ rule
seemed to grow more pronounced in
proportion as their dearly won privi-
leges’ increased. Nothing seemed to
rouse this resistance in the 'Tzech
more surely than the language ques-
tion. It was something the signifi-
cance of which the lowljést peasant
could understand, and something
which came home to him personally
and vitally the moment he entered
the imperial. army as a conscript.
The rule that there should be only
one language in the army, and that
German, struck him at “once a8 an
assault upon his rights. Herein lay

 

 

the common source of friction be-
tween the German and the Tzech ele-
ments, The Tzech soldier had only
to refuse to answer his superiors in
German to probably cause one of

The revolt would often spread to

made common cause with the Tzech
soldiers, There would be demonstra-

the attention of the won will be
drawn as ¢o that leaser kjown Slo-
vakia, which, as the third jart in the
tripartite republic, joins Moravia on

‘Its eastern boundary. Befsye the war

ita existence was hardly gueased by
the man in the street; jiideed it did
not figure upon the ordinary school
map of the Austro-Hungérian empire.
Its people, though distinct now, are
probably remnants of tiie old Tzéch
family detached from the once Great-
er Moravia in those days when it ex-
tended 4s far south a5 the Adriatic.
As a dominant power, Moravia came
to an end when {t'was ¢onquered by
Hungary,

But Stovakia fias suddenty come
into the limelight by the prompt
action ‘of Tzech troopa in taking
possession of territories hitherto
hela to be part of the Hungarian
crown, and by the quick retaliation
on the part of the Hungarians, who
have attompted to eject the Tzechs
on the ground that the Allfes have |
agreed not to interfere in the internat |
affairs ofHungary. But, according to!
the Tzech, the people of the terri-
tories of the new Slovakia, which are
understood to include Presaburg, the’
ancient Hungarian crowning capital,
and the line of the Danube to the
point where it bends suddenly south-
ward toward Budapest, speak the
Tzecho-Slovak tongue; whilst on the
southern boundary and paurteof the
northern or Carpathian border, the
people comprise Slovaks, Ruthenlans
and Magyars, This northern bound-
ary- follows the line of the Carpath-
jans through the famots High Tatra
region and extends eastward almost
fait way across Hungary. Moravia,
at the same time Ia Delleved to lay
claim to the greater part-of Austrian
Silesia, whith separated it
Prussian Silesia. Thus the once no-
torious strip of land or gallery which
led to Galician Poland, and formed
the only outlet of Bohemia for her
goods into Russia and Polamd, has
beén, widened into a broad stretch
of térritory from which .Humgary,
Austria and Germany are completely
shut out,

Should these newly defined bound-
aries, which have already brought the
young* Bohemian republic into dis-
favor with Hungary, be wpheld at
the Peaee Conference, the long
threatened ‘action of thesCemtral em-
pires in shutting Bohemia off econ-
omically from the surrounding world
becomes impossible. A friendly and
united Poland to the nortt& and east
would see to it that Bohemaia’s mer~
chandise reached the sea amd the ouf*
er world by way of the mew Polish
part of Dantzig on the Balitic The
Christian Science Monitor.

Had To’ Be Carefull.

The best stery the Peaow Confer-
ence has brought out is thant told in
the NewYork Worldi When the
German - fleet surrendereti to the
British the captive crews were taken
abohrd British battleships One big
round-headed German wms plainly
disgusted’ with the way things had
gone and showed it, Walling up to
a group of British saitoms he spat
overboard and sald; ‘'Thait’s what I
think of your verdammt fleet, and
as for Admiral Beatty, wity’—and
he spat over the ral) agaim. Then
he spat a third time by Way of ex-
pressing his opinion.of the whole
British nation. As he finished, a big
British sailor hitched his pants up
and ‘said: ‘‘Look here, Fritz! You
can say what you please about the
British fieet—and as’ much as you
wish toward Admiral Bemtty — and
think what you want abeut the Brit-
ish. But you be damn well careful

Leap Year.

Leap year |Is a.year which leaps
over, as-it were, One day more than
an ordinary year; a year which con-
tains 366 days, as distingmished from
an ordinary year, which includes
only 365 days, EVery year the num-
ber of which is divisible by four is a
leap year, except when it happens
to be any number of findreds not
divisible by four. Thus 1884 was a
leap. year, but not 1900, this omis-
sion of leap; years in such cemturies
being necessary to correct the error
which arises from the excess of the
addition of one day in four years
(i. @, six hours) to the year over
the true length of the yeair, L.e., 366
days 5 hours 49 minutes. 4

single lot came across country from i
San Francisco to Detroit In-a special |
train of twenty-six cars, last week. |
‘The, welght of the shipment was 2,-
"| 240,000 pong The rubber was con-
signed, to the ‘Morgan & Wrigtit™tire
plant of the United States Rubber Co.
It arrived in San Francisco from Sing:
apore on the Siberia Maru’on March
Ist, and represents part of the large
accumulations of crude rubber Held
back ‘In the Far East by the embargo
on importations. To the rubber ‘ex-
pert a shipment of this size isa mat-
ter of amazement, more than to the
average man unacquainted with the
infinitely slow processes by which
such stores of rubber “are built upi|.
The shipment in question »represents
the entire production of about 560,000
rubber trees for an entire year and
the labor of. more than 1,000 men for
the same period. Every. working day
of the year the tappers ~ visit’ every

am here in pursuance of a request
made to me in writing by Sir Wilfrid
the day before he was fatally’stricken.
Speaking of Union.Government and
those who supported !t, Mr. Graham
declared {t.to be the wish of-the new
leader. D. D. Mackenzie, as well as
of Sir Wilfrid, that‘all differences
which -had existed between Liberals
should be submerged in the great de-
sire to apply to the reconstruction
period those principles of Liberajism
that had recreated Canada after 1896,
and which have been synonymous with
harmony and progress in every. coun-
try wherever  .applied: When the
earth trembled’ and the universe
rocked, men’s minds changed not once
but many tJmes, but the Liberalism
which we profess is sufficiently broad
to allow of conscientious differoncea
without political disturbance. The
speaker Said -that the* party form of
government was the best that had yet
been devised for the protection of the
public. It provided for piercing acrut-
iny and unrelenting criticlum,. and
when. the sparks fly in a warm de-
bate, the fise*is separated from the
true and legislation is perfected to q
far greater degree than it. would be
without criticism. Call them what
you may, it is the right’of the masses
tobe protected, there nmtust be an op-
position as’ well as ‘a government, and,
consequently, two parties, ‘The prin-
ciples $f Liberaliam and Toryism are

grief and of the nation’s sorrow.
Moved by Gowan» Malott, seconded
by W. .T. Wilkinson, at thig.the first
“2 opportunity since the armistice was
signed, this Liberal convention of
South Essex desires to place on re-
‘cord, its gratitude to Divine Providence
that’ victory hns been achieved. We
“rejoice that tiie British flag thus files

is freed from’ the danger of Prussian
might» We also desire to place on re-
cord our pride in the herofc actions of
our Canadian boys ané our everiasting
Indebtedness tO those whose sacrifice
made this victory possible. We re-
. “joice that many from this. conatitu-

* Moved by Colin Botsford, seconded
by Petér Upcott, that the Liberals of

(Copyright, 1918, by
Syndicate.)

   

‘Pulled “his line from the water, and
| then erled out with disgust. The fish,
ff there had been one, had got away.

Three hours without a catch—it was
enough to annoy a man with normal
nerves, and Horace was far from that.
He drew in his line angrily and at-
tempted to wind it up, but something
had gone wrong with his reel, That
Was the’ last straw. He sat down on
f rock and swore. ‘

The sound of the word startled him.
He had “not ‘sworffor yenrs, His
nerves were certainly making a wreck
of him. The solitude of the place was
aggravating. him, too. They had told
him the simple camp life, with lofs of
fishing, would make a new man of him,
Such bosh! Why, there-was hardly a
thing about it that did not make him
Teel worse.

—Phis was the second day, and he
was going to make it his Inst, To be-
&in with, hesind had trouble pitching
his tent.~ The storm in the night had
kept him up keeping out the rain. Ev-
ery crack of tlie bushes or sound of
the birds.in the trees caused him -o
Start uneasily. It was ngarly 08 nerve-

racking as on afternooh session with
the fourth-year elass, The thought
of the fourth-yeir girls irritated him
the more. They liad been the enuse
of his breakdown, he felt confident:

For months he had looked with dread
on the hour each afternoon that he
Was forced to tench them mathematics.
They were just silly, thoughtless girls,
nnd would not have been so hard to
put up with had-Tt hot been for. their
ringleader, Cynthia White.

Without exaggeration Cynthia was
the worst girl he had ever hand under
his tuition, Her main object in life
seemed to be to*torment the professor
of muathematies. Something alwnys
turned up for her to argue about or
laugh over, Tiere was always some-
thing, for her to ridicule, and she ney-
er missed an opportunity to make him
feel mean—perhaps because she was
80 large and he was so small.

As he snt there thinking it.ever, Hor-
ace made up his mind he had been
foolish. It would hnye Deen easy to
hinye arranged forsher dismissal from
the college. “Why hadn't he done it?
There wis something he ifked about
Cynthia, in spite of everything. The
spirit of fun behind those twinkling
blgck eyes of hers appealed to him,
and the warmth of her laugh made him
long for something—something that
was not in his life.

Suddenly the Jaugh sounded close be-
side him. He nearly toppled into the
water from the shock it gave him. He
turned quiékly to confront Cynthia, a
litle way off, her eyes bulging over
with merriment. After rubbing his
eyes to make sure he was seeing
aright, Horace smiled forth a greet-
dng. . Even the pest of his life was wel-
come in thn solitude.

“Oh, Mr. Sangster, you look so fun-
ny there,” she laughed. “If the girls
‘could only. see you in your bare feet !”

“Heavens!” Horace tried to hide
his feet behind a log. He had forgot-
ten that he had,taken off his Shoes and
sdeks to wade a creek.

“Don't be alarmed,” she smiled en-
courngingly,,“I am going to take off my
shoes, too. -Ohe can’t fish well with
How do you like my cos-

 

tume?”

She was clad in khaki from head to
foot, and her hair was hanging in ‘curls
over her shoulders, He had never re
allzed how beautiful she was before,

“Jove! You Jook peachy,” he mur.
mured, admiringly, not realizing that
he had, used the word “peachy” for the
first ‘time since he had got hisegree.

That encouraged Cynthia to take na
seat beside him. Not that she needed
encouragement, for she would have sat
there sooner or Inter. It did pot take
Horace long to forget that he was a
college professor and she was a mere
student. Soon they were chatting
Bayly. J 2

Her home was near by and she had
spent every summer fishing in that
strenm for years, She led him to a
place where he jwas “sure to catch
something, no matter how / oor an an-
gler he was." -When his luck’ remain-
ed poor and he still made vain attempts
to land a trout, Cynthia did not fail to
laugh at him and ‘assure him that he
was as funny as he could be.

Somehow it did®not bother him to
be Inughed at out there. The air seem-
ed to have got into his blood and given
him a sense of humor that. responded.
Xovher witty ridicule,” He was:not long
in catching onto the right way to draw
in the line, and before the afternoon
wis over he was catching as many
trout as Cynthia. When théy parted
he had gained her promise to. search
him ont the next day. 5
. Camping agreed with him after that”
Fishing was the most wonderful sport
fn the world when one had a compan-
fon like Cynthia, he decided after two
weeks of glorious days. Nérves? Why,
he bad forgotten he had such things!
|» They would haye still stayed out of
his mind had it. not been ‘that a falny,

JULIA WARD HOWE’S SALON

As Hostess It Was Said of Her With
Truth That She Delighted in
Contrasts.

 

 

When I think of {t.I believe that I
had a salon once upon a time. @ did
not call it so, nor even think of {t om
such; yet within {t were gathered
people who represented many and va-
rious aspeets of life.. They were gen-
uine people, not Jay’ figures distin-
guished by- names‘ and clothes. The
earnest humanitarian interests of my
husband brought to our home a num-
ber of persons interésted in ‘reform,
education and ptogress, Jt was my
part to mix in with this-graver ele-
ment as much of social grace and
genlality-as I. was able to gather
about me. I was never afratd to bring
together persons who rarely met else-
where thap at my house, confronting
Theodore Parker with some arch-
priest of the old orthodoxy, or Wil-
Nam Lloyd Garrison with’ ‘n “decade.
perhaps, of Beacot street dames, A
friend sald, on one of these occasions:
“Our hostess delights Jn contrasts.” I
eonfess that Idid; but I think that
my greatest pleusure was In the les-
sons of human compatibility. whict 1
learned in this-wise. I-started, indeed,
witlt the conviction that thowaht and
character’ are the foremost values In
society, and was not afraid or asham- ”
ed to offer these to my guests, with or
withofit the stamp of fashion and po-
sitlon.—Julia Ward Howe.

Catholic College of Maynooth receiv-

the bishops. This, according to Mr,
MacManus, caused George Moore to
withdraw his patfonase from’ the
Roman Catholle Church and become
an Episcopalian. In th!§ connection,
Mr. MacManus says that Mr. Moore
announced fils intention !0 a letter
to the Protestant Archbishop of Dub-

Moore from Mr. Smith, expressed
gratification at his decision and told

him to apply to the rector of his
parish. This Mr. Moore, ~some-
what taken back, did;» but the

rector was also in ignorance of his
fame, and told him to write to his
curate, who would | recelye him.
The hardworked . curate received
the“Jetter and informed Mr, Moore
that if he would appear at a-certain

Properly received. He also told him
to»apply at the office of the Evange-
lical Society, where he could get a

THE WEEK IN THE LEGISLATURE

The Legislature has commenced ta
wake up, and during the past week
considerable progress has baen made
with ‘the -work of ‘the session, A
great many important matters, how-
ever, remain to be dealt with betore
prorogiation.

Thirteen bills now appear on tie
Order Paper ready for third reading.
Tho Government manages to raduce
the number of etka Ca outstanding
from time to time but the Oppositica
{s in an Inquisitive mood and continu-
ously ‘Piles the Government with fur-
ther Interrogations.

- Two important motions emanating
from the Liberal side of the House
will come,up for discussion during
we weak, one by Mr. Parllaniént. of
Prince Edward, demanding pr commis-

sion to study the reason of the decline |_

‘in rural population, which has ‘besn
outstanding for some time, and the
other by Co}, Atkinson, of. N. Norfolk,
in regard to the necessities ot the
present readjustment period succecd-
ing the war. Mr. Atkinson impresses
upon the Government the novasaity
for passing legislation to provide for
such matters os a fair wage, fair
prices for the product of the faym,
encouraging men t0°RO back t» the
land,* pensions for widows with de-
pendent chijliren,,. the suppression of
feeblemindédness and social discasas,
und bya@making a close study of all
matters relating to the health and
welfare of the people of tlie Province
(including unemployment) with a
view to the enlargement of the com-
fort and happiness of the people.

Dewart Charges.—Warly in the week
the Prime Miniater announced the op-
pointment of Sir Willlam Meredith,
Chief Justice of Ontario, to invoyti-
gate the charges made by H. H, Dew-
art, M.P.P; for S. W. Toronto, in con-
nection with the enforcement of the
liquor law in the Provinee, .and par-
ticularly in regard to the allegations
against the conduct of officers of the
Government in the Homer Hquor case.
Peter White, K.C,, has been appoint-
ed to assist the Chief Justice in the
conduct -of the investigation. Mr.
Ayearst has been suspended pending
the investigation, and one of the re-
sults of the charges has-been the re-
signation of George BH. Morrison, a
provincial license inspector. The
Government is referring the public
accounts which Mr. Dewart wishes
iivestigated to the Public’ Accounts
Committee.

Subsequent to the appointment of
the commissioner, Mr. Proudfoot, the
leader of the Opposition, raised cer-
tain questions in the House, a3 fol-
lows: (1) Whether the appointment
of Sir William Meredith as a commis-
sioner wouki come before the House
as+a motion for consideration; (2)
whether counsel, who may call Wit;
nesses, will be allowed and pall to
represent the Opposition upon the
hearing before the commission; (3)
whether the scope of the commission-
er's powers has been more fully con-
sidered bythe. Governmen’; (4)
whether the commissfoner’s powers
include an investigation into the ad-
ministration of the O. T, A, and the
enforcement of the law and matcers
arising out of or relating to the con
duct of the liquor branch of the de-
partment.

The reply of the Premier was that
the Government was issuing the
Commission itself and that no other
counsel. would be appointed  excsot
Peter White to assist the Commission.
The’.Commission’ would only fuyeatl-
gate the matters specifically charged
by Mr. Dewart, and the Public Ac-
counts: Committes gvould be an ave-
nue whereby Mr. Dewart could secure
whatever inforfiation he sought re-
lating to,the fccounts. Mr. Dewart
supported Mr. Proudfoot in’ is de-
niand f{6r“representation by counsel.
but ft is unlikely thetwthis willy be
grantéd, "

r “Blue-Sky” Legislation.

A hill to regulate the sale of sharns,
bonds, etc,, has been introduced by
the Attorney-General. The. bill ap-
Poliits a commissioner to examine into
tlie kind of shares which promoters
desire to place upon, tho market, It
{s expected, however, that’ this bill
will fall %through on account of the
opposition which has developed to it
throughout tWe,country. The Attor-
ney-General said.that the prihciple of
“blue-sky” legislation had been en-
dorsed by a great number of compe-
tent Judges but when it came_ to
drafting a bill the difficulties had been
found almost insurmountable,

NOTES.

The Government has at last accept-
ed the argument of Liberal members
jn’ regard to permitting ,» women to
take seats ip the Legislature if elect-
ed, and also permitting them to be
elected’ to municipal office. At the
timo of the passing of the Franchise
Act of 1917 giving women thesright
to vote in Ontario Provincial  eiac-
tions the Liberals. emphasized the
logic of following th{s up by permit-
ting those new voters to represent the
people if so. desired. -, The Liberals
could not suppress their mirth at
this fresh evidence of the, Govern-
ment’s péttiness in yoting down Lik-
eral proposals and afterwards adopt-
ingethem as thelr own.

The. Government also introduced a
bill to enable farmers’ wives to be-
come members of school boards. -..

Bstimates to*the tune of. over’ $3,-

boonepo were passed during the week.

Two interesting {tems were , $10,000
forsmedical and dental inspection ‘in
Public and Separate “schools, ‘and

}$214,000 for technical education. The

{tems were closely criticized but went
