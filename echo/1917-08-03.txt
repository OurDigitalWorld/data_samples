at the price. ;

Three styles only. They could not be made for the
price by the ordinary individual. It is a case of having
the materials at an old price and making them in large
quantities. If we had asked $1.25 for them they would
not have been considered dear, but it is always our policy
to sell as cheap as possible and give our customers ad-
vantage of big buying.

were enlisted jn Canada since tie be-
ginning of the war, The number is
given in a return presented in the
House of Commons in response to a

that 152,000 natives of the British Isles

province of Ontario from Montreal to

the Detroit River will b@ taken over
by the Government on August 21st,
Commissioner
vincial

McLean, of the Pro-
Highways Department, an-

nounces; This section will comprise

that part of the Kingston Road run-
ning eastward'from Highland Creek to

Port Hope and will be about 62 miles
in length. Excepting those portions of
the road within the limits of munict-
palities it will from August 2ist be

maintained by the Province, which will

provide for 70 per cent. of the main-
tenance cost, It runs through Ontario
and Durham ‘¢ounties and the follow-
ing townships; Pickering, Whitby,
Whitby East, Darlington, Clarke and
Hope. The policy of the Department
{sg to divide the highway into sections
of about 50 miles each and gradually
to develop each section. The organ-
ization for each section will consist of
six meni and three teams, who will be
permanently engaged in this work. In
order that there may be,more men
available for harvesting the Minister
of Public Works has issued orders for
the temporary albandonment oi the
surveying “of the lhighway from Brock-
yille east to the Quebec boundary.

The Government was not prepared
to go far this session in the matter of
liquor prohibition legislation. Amend-
ments to the Doherty Act of last ses-
sion were submitted to the House.
There is to be no nation-wide~prohli-
bition as a by the delegates again
on last Friday, but a certain tighten-
ing up of the present law. Prosecutions
will be*authorized either in the pro-
vinces from which shipments aré made
in violation of Jocal acts or in that to
which they go. Fuller authority will
be given to seize and hold liquor
which often before the trial has dis-
appeared. An eméirely new amend-
ment prohibits the use of the mails
for literature advertising liquor when
any province makes it an offense for
such -matter to ‘be cireulated within
its bounds. There {8 no intention of

POTATO CROP INSURANCE.

It is estimated that 25 per cent.,of
the potato crop of Ontario -or
approximately 5,000,000 bushels is
lost annually by the farmers
of Ontario due to attacks of the
Late. Blight, and the Colorado Potato
Beetles... This loss can be prevertted
by. spraying thoroughly at regulor in-
tervals with Bordeaux Mixture;cs a
fungicide to prevent blight, and Paris
green or arsenate of lead as a pofson
to combat .the beetles.

Late Blight®is a° fungus disease
wifich is particularly noticeable on
potatoes fn late summer and is) quite
serious when the weather {s “all warm,
moist and muggy. It is first notfeeable
in the form of dark colored spots on
the leaves, which ‘soon begin to’ curl
up and’in some instances the diseased
portions of the leaves and stems emit
a smell like that 6f bad fish, A care-
ful examination: of the under surface
of the leaves where these brownish
spots appear will reveal the presence
of a grayish white “mould” or “mil-
dew.” The spores produced in these
spots on the leaves are scattered by
wind and water and are capable of in-
fecting a healthy- potato leaf and
starting the disease ofresh. If no
spraying has been done and weather
conditions are at all fayorable, the
spores thus pragoted rapidly infect the
surrounding plants and the disease
spreads most rapidly. The disense can
be prevented by thoroughly spraying
with Bordeaux mixture. It is an in-
surance, in fact an investmeént.worth
while.

Bordeaux Mixture.

The Bordeaux Mixture for control-
ling LatesBlight, also Early EBltsht.
should be very carefully prepared and
applied in a very thorough manner in
order to be effective. The formula is:

Anderdon sheep growers are greatly
pleased with the result of selling their
wool to the Ontario Wool Co-Operative.
Association. Colin Botsford shipped
12 pure bred Oxford fleeces, and re-
celved acheck for $75—$6.25 per
fleece, or an average of 66 cents per
pound. This was a good deal better
than he expected. Fred. Pettypiece
and R. E. Golden, who also took ad-
vantage of the co-operative selling,
were sntisfled with their returns.

County Clerk W. P. Coyle is one
who recognizes in his daily Ife that
faith without works is a dead one. He
had faith that when the time came for
harvesting the Anderdon crop that city
men would respond to the call for
laborers, but backed up thnt fact with
a week of real old-fashioned work in
the hayfield, returning Saturday night
to his duties in Sandwich, consider-
ably tanned but conscious of the fact
that he had done his duty and set an
example for members of the Windsor
Board of Trade to follow.
