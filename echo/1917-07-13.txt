completed the first inspectian and
judging of the more than eighty gar-
dens entered by Amherstburg school
children in the Back Yard Vegetablé
Garden Contest. In the class of gar-
dens of 150 square feet fre 45 com-
petitors from among the younger chil-
dren; 25 competitors in the 260°square
feet gardens, and about the same num-
ber in the 400° square feet class. The
judgés report that generally the gar,
dens are above the usual order of
merit. A fine variety of vegetables
hos been raised, which ore well look-
ed after, kept clenn and “nicely ar-
rangéd. Old gardeners will have to
hustle to beat the gardens of the
school amateurs.

—Women tenchers employed by
Windsor school board must make up
thelr minds to become “6ld maids,”
The border city’s schoo) trustees have
decided against re-engaging teachers
who contemplate marriage, This de.
cision was made Tueaday night, when
Mrs; Harry Harris (nea Maisie -Mc-
Kim) and Miss Irvine applied for po-
sitions on the teaching staff. Mrs.
Harris is the bride of a Kingsville
soldier, while Miss Irvine, one of the
most succesaful teachers at Assump-
tion street sohool, is engaged to be
married. Trustee Fred. Allworth, the
only bachelor on the board, supported
the cause of the married ladies but
wos “trun down.” The members of
Windsor &choo! board act more like a
bunch of “old women” than like any-
thing else -having human shape. Jub
why war brides should be penalized
is mighty bard to understand. -

—“George Connors, of Parkhill, Do-
minion fruit~inspector, was a visitor
in London Mondayon hia way to
Leamington. ‘The strawberry grow:
ers are not filling their boxes the way
they. should, sajd Mr, Connors.. ‘I
find that practically oll the berry box-
6s that 1 have éxamined through tha,
district have been but two-thirds full.
I have warned a number of men same,
on your own market, and they have
got to live up to the law. Whon the
public are paying for a full box, they
should get a box with tho berries oven
with the top. ‘There were few berries
in the stores today, but I could not
find a craté that had overy es filled
properly. Howéver, as I sald before,
the growers haye received their warn-
ing, and it is up to them’ from now
on. 1 will be back later in the. week
to look over the market again. 1" — St,

SATISEACTION

Wherever you find Ford cars and Ford service, you find
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who eppreciate the car
for its quick starting, its easy control, ite simplicity and
its extraordinary capacity for hard work,

The phenomenally large sme of Ford cars {5 the direct
result of Ford)SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION.

Fer satisfaction is o8 universal as the Ford car itself.
Doctors, Inwyers, salesmen, bakers, grocers and farmers
all praise the Ford—all are satisfied.

Its low:.cost appeals to them. Its unusually low upkeep
cost pleases them. Its sturdy, sténdy, service-giving char-
acter wins them and satisfies them. Even the wealthy
prefer to drive Ford cars rather than bot) ur with-the cost-
ly, cumbersome limousine and. chauffeur. It menns econ-
omy,;when."soving is a national duty.”

Ford satisfaction is just.n8 valuable as upholstery, or a
fancy finish, Ask any Ford owner about it.

If you intend to buy a Ford, place your order wlll: the
nearest dealer.
