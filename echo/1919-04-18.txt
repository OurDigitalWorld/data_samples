tion passed at the last meeting giv-
ing the Board of ‘Works authority to
go ahead With drains on the Pike. He
wanted to hear the report_of the com-
mittee.

Dr. MeBride stated ttiat tte Board of
Works had Mr. Bray go over and take

the Jevels and they now had men
digging and putting in the tile.
Mr. Laramie explained that they

had put-in a 12” tile from end of the
draim to corner of Brock street, and
a catch basin, which the council will
likely have to pay for itself as Mr.
Cuddy agreed only to bear 50 of the
cost of a 7” tile.

Mr. Brown asked the Board of
Works why ‘the town should go to the
expense af putting in another drain
there when Maldén had agreed to take
this water.

Mr. Laramie—‘The town is not pay-
ing for any water except on the Pike.
There is a-6-foot fall from the second
concession.to the town.”

Reeve Brown—“Why did Malden
assess the properties to. the. 2nd _Con-
cession drain if the water coaldn’t go
into “it?”

Dr. McBride thought there could be
some Wwatergo from Frank Goodchild’s
across thd Nelds to the 2nd concession
road drain. But it is blocked near
the drain.

The council threshed the
out for some time and then.

Dr. McBride wanted to know what
Yeport had been made on the»King

would ‘seg Afr. Newmin personally.

Mr. Laramie aaked if the. solicitor
had given his opinion regarding the
collection “of billiard licenses in ar-

known he was to give an opinion.

the fwo-in-One factory roof, and the

Reeve Brown.thougt that if this

money were spent In atvertising this

to the town and get it of ovr hands.
Mr. Denike—‘It's only reasonable
that this roof should be repaired.” in

The dampjng-off diseases or bed rot
of the plants often proves fata to the
success” of the bed: This disease
usually occurs on unsterilized beds
where the plants are the thickest and
js characterized by the appearance of
a slimy rot on the stalk-of the plant
just above the surface of the ground.
Some plants recover from the disease;
however, it is not advisable to use
such plants aa they afe very slow to
grow and seldom, if, ever, produce a
good yield. Practically the only. rem-
edy known for this disease, after it
occurs, consists’ of thinning out the
plants, giving plenty of ventilation,
and allowing the}bed to dry out for
a while. f

About a week before transplanting
the seedlings shohld be hardened off
to enable*them to! stand transplanting
satisfactorily. ‘This {fs accomplished
by letting the beds dry ont somewhat,
removing the covering during the
day, and even ‘leaving it of over

However, the planté should tot be

MERCANTILE LOSSES,

One Sacrifice Made by Grent Britain
In War,

In urging that immediate steps be
taken to rebulld the British merchant
marine, Archibald S. Hurd, the naval
writer, in an articlo in the London
Telegraph, says that, although the
United Kingdom was not invaded,
Great Britain has paid for victory in
the loss of moré than 9,000,000 tons
of shipping, tem times os much as
that lost by either France or Italy,
The British losses were 17 times ag
much as that of the United States,

“Owing! to Mttle having been said
of the injuries inflicted on this coun-
try in the war,” Mr. Hurd Says,
“there is am dippression in Allied
and neutral countries that we pald a
relatively small price for victory. It
ig true that’ we were not invaded,
but that was due, not to good for-
tune, for the sea Is the easiest and
quickest medium for. an Anvader,
but to good policy.» It Is also true
that we were not starved, but that
was the result of judgment and or-
ganization, It is very neceasary that
due importance should “be attached
{0 the injury inflicted upon us as a
people who follow the sea, because
there is a temptation-to exaggerate
the damage sustained by the Allies
on the land and to ignore the results
of enemy action! by-sea.

“Tt is certain that if it had not
been for the British merchant’ navy
France and Italy would hitve been
driven out of the war and Ameriéa
would never have been able to inter-
vene, When the war came the vast
Volume of British merchant shipping
was placed at the service of the state
and became the principal target of
the enemy’s naval forces. The result
was that approximately half the ton- |
nage under the British flag was de-
stroyed

“The following tigures show the
total losses in gross tonnage ofmer-
chant steamers sustained by this
and other countries during the war:

, The Bell& of London, ..

In, the days’ before clocks, to say
nothing of watches, were common,
the bells of London octupled a much
Niore important position -thin~ they
do to-day. ‘'Prentices depended on
this, bell and.that to call them” un-
willingly from work of an evening,
whilst bells were requisitioned for
all manner of special purposes, -And
60 thereswere miiny, bell foundries
in the-@ity., Relics of them are to be
found jn. many places, evem if it is
only a street name, such as Billiter,
street, which, as Mr, Lanfear Lucas
points out,. was, undoubtedly  Bell-
sitgers or Founders Lane... Then’ Bel-
size probably owes its name, he de-
clares, to a bell foundry on the lower
part of Hampstead Hill. Something
of this sort is all that remains of
fiainy of them, but others, like the
Whitechapel Bell Foundry, which has
been charged with retuning and re-
hanging the bells of Westminster
Abbey for the peace rejoicings, have
continued ,to do. business through
the centuries.’ The foundry commenc-
ed bustmess in 1570.

Firth of Forth.

The Pirth of Forth is, of course,
one of the most notable things in all
Scotland, From Kincardine, where it
officially begins, to that imaginary
line just west of the Isle of May,
from the East Neuk of Fife to the
mouth of the Tyneé, in Haddington,
shire, where it officially ends, is &
distance of 48 miles; while from
shore to shore from one and a half
miles, at Queensferry to seventeen
and o half miles off-the Isle of May,
says an exchange. Within this great
expanse of water whole fleets may
ride at anchor in perfect safety, and,
although little is known of the great
scenes which miust have taken place
in these waters during the last four
years, the story of the Firth of Forth
during the great war, culminating,
'as it did the other day, with the sur-
render there of the German high seas
fleet, will be not the least interesting
of *the many stories which still, re-
main to be written.

Wanted Glasses,

The battalion commander saw a;
fire on the opposite hilly and think-
‘ing it might beja signal, despatched
his orderly for a pair of glasses! The

A Tonic Medicine Is A Necessity
at This Season,

Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People are an all-year-round tonic,
blood-builder and nerve-restorer. But
they are especially valuable in the +
spring when the system is loaded with
impurities as a result of the -indoor
life of the winter months. There is
no other season of the year when the
blood {8 so much jn need of purifying
and enriching, and every dose of these
pills helps to make new, red blood. In
the spring one feele weak and tfred—
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills give new

Says: “My trouble was one of gen-
weakness, which thinned’ my
blood and gave me at times unbear-
able henddches, loss of appetite and
also loss in .weight. I tried several
medicines, but without succeas.. Then
I heard of Dr, Williams’ Pink Pills and
decidéd to give them a fair trial;
The result is that I feel like a new
person. My appetite improved, I
gained in weight,smy blood is thor-

of some unsightly pimples which had
troubled me.. If one good turn de-
serves another then T have much

ery municipality served -by the rdl- 7
way, were’@ unit in declaring that the
Ume was now opportune to’ buy out
tlré road at a figure to be arrived at, |
if necessary, by a board of arbitration
to be appointed by the«Government.

The only difference between the
courciimen grew aut of a resolution
offered by Barrister O, BE. Fleming, K.
C., delégate -from Ojibway,;who con-
sidered that a local commission shonid
be selected to act with’ the provincial
commission in desling withthe com?
pany. This, however, met with littl
favor, only Councillor B. Pacaud, of
Sandwich, and another rural council-
Yor voting with the Ojibway repre-
sentative, Foil

In a report to the convention, the
Hydro-Electric: Commission, © which» »
wilfwhave charge, of operation of the
system .in-the event of the munici-
palities becoming owners, declared
that the Investigation” into the -con-
dition of the trackage and equipment
had been hampered by,the company’s
refusal to give information necessary
for a complete report. ¥

The report further stated that, ar
though-an estimate of the value of
the system had been made by the en-
gineers, this would not be made pub-
lic until a reasonable opportunity pre-
sents itself.” The commission believes
the only solution of the transporta-
tion problems ‘along the border is for
the municipalities to purchase the .
railvAly at the esrlier possible mo-
ment. The plan of the company to
build the Ferry avenue loop to give
better service to the west side of
Windsor and Sandwich was advised
ageirnst jn the report. j

FINDS CALL STIRS HIM UP

City Conductor's Call, “Let ’Em Off

on This Writer.

Tint day does not start right when I
Mo not go to work by public convey-
ance. I can motor to work,°or I can
walk, as I sometimes do, and hear all
the sounds incident to busy streets—
the honking of horns, the whistles of
the traffic policemen nnd the shoutin
of newsboys. These all help in gettiig
me in, key for the day's work, but
they do not take the place of the con-
/ductor’s plea ‘to the clamorous crowds
on the railway platforms, “Let 'em o
first 1” .

The command js given in a tone of
nuthority that forces the people to
stand back. You meditate upon what
| would. happen but for the tralnman’s
) solicitude for his passengers. The little
| blond “stenographer who sat beside

you would without doubt be carried to
| the next Station, or maybe’ a dozen
)'stations beyond, and, being late, be
fired.. You yourself, for that matter,
might be whisked on past your station
and fall into a passion that would
cause your breakfast to sour and make
you surly all day. And there is/always
tragedy in that frime of mitid, since
a man has fo be placid these days or
Jose his nerves, his; Job, and 6very-
thing. :

“Let ‘em off first!”—the command
affects one in another way, too. It
carries 4 suggestion that one wants to |
get off, and that suggestion presently
works itself into a command to you to
get off—a sort of challenge to stay on
if you dare. :

You battle the suggestion manfully
from one station to another, until, by
the time you reach’ your stop, your
mind is keyed up to concert pitch; you
are thoroughly awake, anid attack your-
day's work with an energy that is un-
imown to the man who, immersed in
his morning papers, is lost to. what ts:

QUEBEC VOTES IN
WINE AND BEER

The referendum taken on Thursday,
April 10th, dn wine and beer licenses
showed that an enormous, majority
voted wet in Quebec province.

The referendum was decided on by
the Provincial. Legislature to settle
the future of the liquor question In?
1918 the Legislature passed, a total
prohibition measure to come into ef-
fect on May 1st, 1919, for “the duration
of thé war” ~The war ending before
thé act could be applied, the Govern-
ment compromised on the - demands
made from the liquor faction, who de-
manded enactment of complete wet
privileges, and those calling for the
enforcement of the act, by submitting
tle question of the sale of beer and
wine alone to the electors.

Issue Bitterly. Fought.

Both liquor and: temperance ‘factions
In the province waged an ~energetic
campaign, the former securing power-
ful support froma number of the most
‘prominent men in ‘Montreal. The
Protestant ministers; were unanimous:
ly in favor of tomplete prohibition,
but the Roman Cat %, priests did
not support the ~< proposals asa
body.

The.strongest temperance organiza-
ition In the! province, the “AntlAlco-
holic League,” wis split. A nulubér of
spenkers in favor of wine and beer
introduced the race and religfoug cry
into: their campaign address argu-
ing that ‘English-speaking Orangemen
and Methodists of Ohtario were anx-
fous to see prohibition introduced) as
1a blow to-the French-speaking Roman
1'Catholles, who needed .wine-for the
sacrament.

No Woman Voted.

No women voted on the referendum.

In the province iS ey whole: the
“wats turned out in great numbers,
while, the “no” element seemed in-
different. In Montreal the “wet” ma-
jorities were enormous: in geveral di-
visions being 75 per cent» —

The referendum result will insure
the sale of wine and beer in districts
only where local legislation has not
introduced ~ prohibition. “Dry” dis-
tricts, though “allowed to vote, will
not become “wet” even though -they
gave a majority in favor of wine and

 

 

  

 

  

 

 

   
    

beer.’
In only one section of Quebec was
the temperance séntimenmt. strong

enought to offset the wet sentiment.
This was in the English-speaking Bast-
ern Townshipss The majorites form-
ing a complete “dry” state were, how-
ever, quite small. .
The new liquor legislation, which
will be given effect to as m result of
the referendum, will come into force
on May Ist next. The districts which
-lwill be affected are Montreal, Sher-
brooke, St. Johns, and a few munict+
palities whfch still grant liquor lie.
enses. 3
The last occasion on which a plebis-
cite on prohjbition=was taken was
nearly 21 years ago. It was on Sep-
tember 29th, 1898. -The result of that
plebiscite in the, Province of Quebec
was a2 majority of"94,032 votes against
prohibition. 5

WHY CANADA MUST
FINANCE HERSELF

 

Canada must finance herself,
if for no other reason than that
are great majority of countries
that formerly invested annually
millions of dollars abroad, have
forbidden the use of money for
such»purposes, until their domes-
tie demands for capital have
been satisfied.

In the British House of Com-
mons. recently, the Chapcellor
of the Exchequer sald that as*
long as domestic demands for
new capital, both for trade and +
industry and for natioual pur-
poses were so pressing, he lid
not think it would be safe to
remove restrictions upon invest-
ments outside the United King-

The more money.that Is “placed

the greater the trade that will

tears,

worthy president, rpped for order,
The knitting needles slowed up and

stopped, for the Jolly Ten could tell
that there wis sometliing On the pres-

Idential mind.

“Girls,” she began. “I have been do-
ing some patriotic thinking Jately, and
I have come to the gonclusion that we
should each buy a War Savings stamp
for the club,” _

A chorus of “ayes” went up and the
president smiled mysteriously.

“Perhaps when you learn the con-
ditions you will have less enthusiasmy”
she warned. ‘We are all of us, as you
know, possessed of More or legs abil-
ity to earn money. I, therefore,
thought {t would be a good idea for
each of us to earn five dollars by our
own Individual endeavor, and with it
buy a War Savings Stamp. Since a
stamp costs only $4.03, the remainder
of our money cin be pit into Thrift
Stamps.

“The more original your method of
earming the money, the better Doro-
thy, for instance, makes luscious

fudge. Y suggest that she make some
of it up into dainty boxes and yell it
to her friends.”

As she finished the buzz of voices
rose excitedly. Only, Peggy ‘knitted on
in troubled silence,-trying to puzzle
out a way to earn five dojlars, On the
way home she appealed to President
Barbara, who promised to help her,

Next evening while reading the pa-
per Barbara came upon a help wanted
ad. that gave her a brillfant inspir-
ation, Half an hour later, when Peg-
gy came in, she was still in deep
thought,

“Have you thought of anything
yet?” were Peggy’s first words. Bvi-
dently the problem had been worrying
her.

“Yes,” Barbara hesitated, “but~ per
haps it may not suit you.”

“T am reiidy for anything,” Peggy
breathed desperately. For’ answer
Barbara handed her the paper, point-
ing to the ad. Peggy rending it, sank

Into the nearest chgir, ‘It seemed prez
posterous. But later, wl.em she -had
thought “it over, and Barfara liad
argued in its favor. she looked at the
plan in a more friendly light.

So next morning found Peggy knock-
ing at the door of an imporsing rebi-
dence in a neighboring town. The lady
of the house, Mrs. A——, proved to be
in dire need of a maid, and a dinner
party Was scheduled for that very
evening, /t0 several of Mr. "3
business friends. ;

That, evening, when Peggy caught
sight of the guests, she formot all she
had even thought she knew about
serving a dinner, and she fervently
wished she had not thought Barbara’s
plan such a bmHtant one. She was
certainly earning her $5. jl

A moment's breathing space came
when she had served the dessert, “and
she had time to pause. Some magnetic
force caused her to raise her eyes;
and they stared straight acr@ss the
table into the eyes of. Tom G—,
President Barbara's big rother.
Tom’s face was a strange mixiture of
astonishment, {nteprogation and ador-
ation .

Poor Peggy was more flustered than
she had ever been in her young life
before! and the spoon that she held
in her hand drohped to the floor with

A

:4 clatter that seemed to -herjover ex-

cited nerves to shake the house. Un-
der the glaring eyes of Mrs, A———
she recovered {t and! retreated to the
kitchen. t

Once in the safely ofthe kifchem
she struggled hard to keep back the
tears. She micht have tojgo into tha»
@iningroom fain, she knew, and {it
would mot do at all for Tom to notice
that hér eyes were guiltily red.
Four months ago Tom and she hag
In_factr
Tom had been trying for ® month to
get up courage to pop the question,
when the usual lovers’ quarrel ardse,,
apparently just to prove that the
course of true love nevef df@ run
smooth. Since ther Pegyy had ‘tried
in vain to forget Tom. and hé in hig
turn had foresworn all thoughts of
gitls in general, and of one girl {jn
particular.

Peggy stood tense, straining her
ears for the sound of the bell that
should summon her back to the @in-
ing-‘room. But they had finished. for
she heard them passing into the mugj{a.
room. Quietly she crept into the now
empty dining-room; pausing to listen.

She heard Tom Jaugh, and the sound
brought the hot tears to her 6yes: The
thought of a dreary life without Tom
proved too much for poor Peggy. She
fled to the seclusion of the back poren,
where she crumpled in a’ wretéhed
heap on the top step. She leaned her
weary head against the piazza raj},|,
stifling a sob. The tears would come,
though, and the filmy lace cap that
had fallen unheeded beside her servey
as a handkerchief in her misery.

Above her the velvet sky was pler..
ed with a thousand diamonds, and the
magical air of soft summer night was |
heayy with fragrance. The throaty |
chorus of the toads in a nearby
meadow broke the summer stillness,
but sdmewhere up under the slielter: |
ing eaves two sleepy swallows were !
twittering. j

‘A door opened softly, so softly that
Peggy did not hear. Tom stood above

her a moment. Then he gathered her, | sistance
tears and all, {nto a smothering em:| gchool boa

brace. There she wept out the whole
story, and’ Tom*didn't seem to mind
it In the least that his snowy shirt
front was being wet with Peggy's!
In fact he seemed to like It.
When Peggy presented her hard-

earned W. S. S. at the next meeting
the Jolly Ten were very curious to
know how she had earned it, but con-
trary to the general reputation of wo-
mankind, she kept it a secret, and to

of the teacher.

THE WEEK IN. THE LEGISLATURE

Great efforts are belng made to con-
clude the business of the session by
Haster, and contrary to: practice the
House sat on Friday night to con-
eludé a debate Initiated by Nelson
"arliament, a Liberal’ member from
Prince Edward county, In which he de-
manded ‘that a non-partisan commis-
mission, including representatives. of
agriculture and Jabor, should be ap-
pointed by the Government to inquire
into the conditions which are ordin-
arily responsible for the continuous
decline in the rural population of the
province. 5

Mr. Parliament was supported in
his motion by other membérs.of the
Liberal Opposition and algo by the
two United Farmers, Ben} Bowman
(Manitoulin) and J. W. Widdffield (N.
Ontario)? Mr. Bowman's interest went
so fap as to second the resolution. Mr,
Parliament, after \setting forth tle
position {n regard to depopulation in
the rural districts, touched on the
problem of agricultural immigration
and inducement to Ontario farmers to’
fremain-in Ontario; He emphasized
the need for market roads rather than
trunk highways, © advocated a miral
banking system and the extension of
Hydro radials. He’ also called the
attention of the Government to thes
unwarranted spread between the —
prices recelved by*the “producér and
the cost to the consumer. The Gov-
ernment amendéd the resolution an
forced through their own) amendment

Liquor Referendum.

A great deal of controversy is taking
place over the “form of the questions.
The temperance people are not find-
ing it so difficult to answer the ques-
tions 48 other people who are not out-
and-out -prohibitionists, because any-
one favoring prohibition merely has to
answer ajl four questions In-the néga-
tive, wherens it is difficult to see hows
it-Is going to work out in the other™
cases, “For instance, ome question hasi-
been raised that {fa majority is in-
fayor of the repeal of the Ontario
‘Temperance Act. how could the Gov-
ernment carry out the wishes of*any
subsequent maforities on the other
three questions ®y amendments to
the Ontario. Temperance Act, which,
it is pointed out, would not then ex-
ist {t4f were repealed under.the first
question?

Educational Matters.

A feature of the week was. thein-
tellectual treat given to the members
of the Legislature on thé occasion of
the first real address of the Hon. ane
Cody a8 Minister of Education. The
Minister in’a very full address, splen- 2
didly rendered, made a survey of the
whole educational system of the Pro-*
vince, Two of the most important
measures. were to provide for con-
solldated schools {nm ~rural districts,
and to change the metiod of enforc-
ing school attencance. Some of the
matters dealt with by the minister
were his intention to provide libraries
dn rural districts and>to train teachers
in the use of libraries, The training -
of teachers in connection with tech-
nical and industrial education will in
future be divided into two sections
ainder separate superintendents,

Grammar*will be combined with com-
. | position so as to make the subject -
fnore attractive to the scholars. Tho

Minister doea ndt propose to do away
with home work, but intimated that
the tasks set might be considerably _

Wightened. Special segondary aogricul-—

commercial’ and technical
are to be provided. ~Every as-
will be given to enable sural
rds to incréase the salaries

Thomas Marshall, Liberal member
for Lincoln, congratulated the Minis-
iter on his able speech, but pointed ont

that alf the various matters referred

to by him had been urged upon the
Government time after time ‘by the *
‘Liberal Opposition.

He assured the
Minister that the Opposition would co- _
