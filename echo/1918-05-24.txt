docks for the Canadian Stee) Corpor-

Partial excavation hus been made
for the big 2,000 feet slip, running

where the street car ruas to Amherst-

Two large excavators, two pile-

At present there aro about eight
thousand huge piles on the ground

trees that come from British Colum

4,000 Acres at Lesst This Year,

for this year. kuch of tke mills are
in the market for all the straw and
seed that can. be secured and good
prieas are ured the grower, The
rr gements made in {he past
bave, for Uie most part, provided’ for
the leasing of flax land by the mills
at a rental of: from $10 to $15 an
acre, The grower ploughed the land,
prepored tne seed bed and hauled
the crop to the mill—except where
the erop was carried on the railroad.
The mill operator Supplied the seed,

three times as fast as a horse and rig—costs Jess to run and keep, and is :
far easier to take care of. .With labor so scarce and high priced, time

means money, so'do not delay in getting your Ford. : ie
