SIR WILFRED LAURIER

Canada’s Next Premier.

We, admirers of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and British Justice, de-
sire to express our deep grati-
tude to Mr. Gregory, i in his
appeal in last week’s edition of
The Echo, so honored and so
complimented Sir Wilfrid by al-
lowing. him a column clean and
-white in his “Union Govern-
ment” advertisement.

We regret that we cannot af-
ford. to return the compliment

| by” giving Sir’ Robert Borden
clean space. We are unable,
owing’to facts and revelations,
to donate to Sir Robert Borden

a column white and clean, and
devoid of criticising.

Sir Wilfrid has supported Sir |

Robert Borden in all hiis reason-
able acts. He has co-operated
just, as far as his clean con-
sefence would permit. Mr. Gre-
gory.accuses Sir Willfrid of hav-
ing done nothing for the war.
Such is fot the truth, but if it
; Were, is it not better to do noth-
| ing well than, something badly?
Better have nothing said of one
than be severely’ erlvicized for
| misconduct. Better be without
publicity if. one ‘has to gain it
by many mistakes. There.is a
>vast difference between jpublic-
ity and notoriety.

Apologists for the plundering: corrupt Borden Administra- '
tion ask the citizens of Canada to forget the scandals, the graft,
the careless expenditure of the funds of the people's treasury,
the toleration of excessive profiteering and countless other in-
excusable facts.

Germany, when she is beaten, will want the World to for-
give her. The despicable nation of brutes will again seek the
friendship and good will of-the world. She will strive to restore
her international commerce which has, in the last half century,
played such a conspicuous part in the processes of her strength-
ening and enrichment. Will the liberty loving nations that are
now, in defense of the noble ideals of freedom, arrayed against
base, treacherous Germany, hasten to forgive that nation for
its heinous crimes against civilization. Will the present enemies
of Hun tyrannical methods immediately forget the atrocious

barbarous conduct of Germany in this great conflict. Many
generations will come and go before Germany's sins will cease
to be remembered and used against her. sThe pages of history
will preserve the record of_this war’ till the end of time. The
blot on the German will never be eliminated from the history of —
the world. Her honour has periShed. Bven time will not bury
her great crimes against humanity. We will not soon forget.

Bete ween,

CAN WE FORGET. i,

Now we are requested by those Canadian wolves in the
spotless skins of sheep to bury the past years of misgovernment

which will be led by Sir Robert Borden, dominated by such as ©
Rogers and strongly influenced by millionaires that have no
qualms of conscience. ~The records of Borderism, Rogerism,
Flavelleism and many other.isms too numerous_to nrention ?
should be sufficient to prove that such men are hopelessly incom— =~
petént and incapable of conducting the affairs of our beloved
Dominion at this critical time. d

The Kaiser has deceived the German people and our “Union- »
ists” are trying to hoodwink the Canadian people. .. Will we be

A democratic Government sheuld be founded on these :
principles: of the people—by the people—for the people, but :
as we examine the records of this dying regime, we are con-
vinced that ‘the péople have received little consideration at the
hands of one ruling power.

HOW. BORDEN HAS TRIED -TO WIN THE WAR.
He’ las spent.the people’s money# recklessly when money :

is so essential for-the prosecution of the war.

He hag given millions to Mackenzie & Mann for worthless
C. N- R, stock.
-' fe has tolerated the heartless profiteer for over three years.
Are profiteers patriots with only the country and its cause at

» heart?

~ He has allowed the. Nationalists, suchas: Bourassa and:
Layergne, ta spread seditious sentiments, unchecked and un-
molested in Quebec—thereby discouraging voluntary enlistment
and patriotism in that abused’ Province. Why? For a_subtle_
purpose. 4 1 :
He advised the Minister of Militia to “go slow” on recruit-
ing. Why? Because voluntary enlistments were too numerous, :
thereby interfering with plans” and” devices which have since

been revealed,
He has given little: cont ideration to the needs, of soldiers

and dependents.

WHAT BORDEN HAS DONE IN A DESPERATE EFFORT TO"
WIN THIS ELECTION.

He has misrepresented by way of his snpporters the attitude \
of Sir Wilfrid concerning the big issue of the day. =.

He and_his followers and newspapers would have it-appear
that all who do not.approve of “Union Government” are disloyal *
and do not want to win the war. Such is utter’folly. Thousands _
of citizens, Conservative and Liberal, cannot support Borden and
his “Union” scheme because of the past, sins and injustices of

Sir Robert's administration.
The M,S. A. has been much adjusted and revised to meet '

_ election requirements. “

He has raised the religious cry, when Téligion has abso-
lutely no part in this war.

He has discriminated against a great many loyal women.
Thousands of patriotic women workers ‘are _denied*the sacred
natilage of voting because they are unfortunate victims of cir-
cumstances. He does not trust those women who have no broth- -
ers, sons, husband in the war.. Why? Are*they not loyal. Are
they not able to think and vote just as sanely’as those that hap-
pen to be represented by immediate ‘connections in the war?”

, Have they tiot tender, motherly hearts capable of sending out

sympathy to the boys at the front. This is reflecting on the in- |
telligence of that body of women,that are the 1 aa of. unjust.
discrimination. Does this measure suggest ‘British fairness and ~
squéreness or does it remind you-of high-handed German deal-

. ing? Can anyone justify this act? Would it not be just as fair ;

to deny nien who are not represented by sons or ‘brothers. in<
khaki, the right-to have a voice in the nation’s affairs Can
we sing “Britain's flag lias always stood for justice” ar “say
consclentiously that partial women suffrage harnionizes with

nothing less than hypocritical. But this is not a British act, it

is a Borden Act.
He has disfranchised- many citizens of foreign birth that ~

‘have taken residence in Canada that wey might be blessed with
the advantages of freedom.

* WHAT BORDEN HAS DONE TO STRENGTHEN HIS SICK
PARTY...

We-must admit that the winning over of a number of Laur-~
ierites to Bordenism was a star in the crown of Bordenism, The

most acceptable to Sir Robert and his men. Floweyer, the greut
Liberal party does not wear deep mourning because of the loss.
Some losses are gains.» Liberalism in the broadest sense has

There is one grand old gentléman, tried and tested and proven

Sir Wilfrid Laurier, distinguished, honoured and respected;
having rendered a.long, faithful and*consecrated service es ‘the

He will give the people a chance to express their opinion
on the*Conscription Bill and if it is the will ofthe people that it
be enforced, he will enforce it fairly and justly.

Sir ‘Wilfrid is a Reformer by name and by action, His
chief consideration has always been the welfare of Canada and
the Canadian people. He has strictly adhered to the big ideals
of the British constitution.

The Pastors’ and Laymen’s Confer-
ence of the Western Baptist“Assocla-
tion was. held in the Essex Baptist
church on Wednesday, November,
2sth. With just a few exceptions all
the churches jn Essex and Kent coun-
ties were représented.> “Intenslye
Cultivation of Our Church Life” was
the theme of tho day, The Rev. D. D.
Burtch, of Palmyra, presided. In the
morning session the Rev, W. C. Pearce
of Presden led a discussion on “In-
tefisive Cultivation of the Sunday
School.” Mr, Laramie, of Colchestor,
opened the afternoon, session. Rov.
W. D. Magee, of Hesex, in dealing
with tho ‘Intensive Cultivation of the
Evening Session” deplored the lack of
thrill that was once characteristic of

ithe evening service, and pointed out

the ‘deep responsibility imposed and
opportunity afforded by such a ser-
vice, ag no other lends itself so rend-
ily to evangélistic effort. In tho even-
ing service there Is tho lure of possi-
billty, as in farming, and to. cultivate
intensively, is to gather every possl-
bility that lends itself to farming:

Rev. W. A.-Ashmore, of Windsor,
gave o vory: original address on “In-
tensive. Cultivation of the Rural
Church.” How to get tho largest aum-
ber of people within. sound of the
preacher's voice, and how to reach
those who ‘never go Into a church
building, were among the problems he
handled. Ono of the best means of
Intensive Cultivation sald the speaker
Is tho syatematic community survey
in Which he would enlist the services
of the church members. Some church
membors would: scorn to think of a
one man ministry, yét thoy created it
by Inck of co-operation. ©»
