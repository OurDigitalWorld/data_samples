GOOD ROADS he UTATION.

A gathering of Dunia men of Am-
herstburg, with representatives from
Malden and Anderdon, met In the old
telephone building Wednesday night
and discussed good roads with County
Treasurer Millen and County Roads
Superintendent Knister, more particu-
larly with reference to the improve-
mont of the River Front road, and the
enlarging of the county roads base)
to embrace) all the municipalities
the .County. It was the ananineln
opinion of all pfesent that the River
Front road from Turkey Creek to Am-
heratburg should in ‘all fairness be tak-
en in as an integral part of the county
system, eligible for both Government
and county assistance as it fg one of
the most imiportant highways in the
county ‘over which the traffic js for
the most part foreign to jthe district;
and besides improvement of the front
road would be offering an inducement
4o manufacturers to locate along the
front and .huild up the southern patt
of the county, the’ same as along Ford
jand Walkerville; the result ‘of thist
would be to reduce the whole county
taxatfon by “reason of the increased
assessment of the county due to the
Jocation of these manufacturing {n
dustries here, After an hour’s discus-
sino, the meeting unanimously. sup+
ported the following resgfution:

Movéd by Mr. ‘Papst, seconded by
Mr. Patton, that this deputation ap-
prove of a whole county road scheme,
supporting an gmended plan.to desig-
nate the River Front road, from Tur-
key Creek, through Amlirestburg, Har-
row, and to Kingsville as a Provin-
¢clal County Highway; failing that.
ask the county for a specific grant of
20 per cent. to aid In building the
Front Road designated at Road -No.
14.

M.C. R. SERVICE.

" Now that the Pers misiane Rafl-
road Company has béen compélled by
the Director-General of Railroads {n
the United States to restore the ser-
vice on their Canadian line that was
withdraWn during “the war, plending
stressful conditions, éven in the, face
of the strongest opposition from *munt-
cipalities thus deprived of the adequate
railway facilities they gave large bon-
usé&)to secure, it {s high time for the
people in this district to bring to the
attention: of the Dominion Railway
Board the tecent action‘of the Michl-
gan Central, the Canadian end of the
NewYork Céntral, in withdrawing one
train’. from the~Amherstburg-Essex
run, giving only one round’ trip: daily
ingtend of the two, trains- each way,
Which they were obligated to give un-
der terms of bonus, agreements with [
the municipalities through which the
railroad runs, years &4go,- No _milroad
should’ be allowed to get away. with
this reduced service lightly, and the ]-
people who are géttin; this raw deal
should rise up and make such a strong
organized protest that the Board
would at Once take notice and force
the-M. C. R, to restore the old time
service to two -passenger traing a day
each way, Ifthe present arrangement
is allowed to stand the Company might
just as well be allowed to-reduce the
schedule ‘to a train every other day,
or a~clear-weather-only service, Ev-
ery change made in the schedule dur-
«jing the past three* months, both for
mail and passengers, has beén for thé
worse, the running of the two round

trips ‘between 9 aim. and 4 Dm., a},

ridiculous farce; and” that -was so ap-
parent, the {dea ‘then was conceived
of cutting off one train, and this will

jcontinue just so long as the people

are apathetic and do not combine to
compel this foréign ‘corporation to
live upto the agreements entered
into and for which they received sub-
stantial ‘bonuses, some thirty years
ago, but which are Just. as Dinding to-

day”as. ever.

ments on the bright or kiln dried to-
bacco soils of EKesex county in co
operation with bright tobacco growers. _

The plan of experiments consists of
accurately measuring and staking ovt
plots of one-tenth acre on uniform soil, ~
representative of the bright tobacco’
solls of the district, applying different
feltilizers and different amounts. of
the aame fertilizer {n the apring he-
fore transplanting the tobacco. In the
fall the plots are harvested and cured, ©
kept separate, stripped and. graded
into bright, red and dark ‘tobacco.
Bach grade js welghed and the -yield
‘per acre calculated. Plots of the
same alze; but having no fertilizer are
used to determine the increase in
yleld due to the fertilizer applie.t.
CThe object of these experiments is
to determine the best formula and
most economical fertilizer for the
production of good quality and yield
of kiln dried tobacco.

In order to fertilize any crop “intelli
gently three things must be known:
what the plant requires;“What is de-
ficient in the soil and «he best
source of plant food to supply the de-
Fertilizer experiments are.
supplementing the physical and chem-
ical studies of the various types and
classes of soils now produting tobac-
co in Canada.

Three elements of plant food are
generally required in-making a com-
plete fertilizer, They are nitrogen, ‘
phosphoric acid and potash. The ex- és
periments during the past two years ‘
have shown that the bright tobacco
soils of Essex need all three of these
ingredients, and that it is very im-
portant that they should be balanced ;
according. to the soil and crop re- q
quirements, , Otherwise the grower
may be applying more than one ele- * ~
Ment than is needed and not enough
of the one most needed, which ig poor
economy. Much better results would
be obtained-in the use of the fertiliz-
ers if we ceased to remember the
name and brand of them and remem-
bered thei analysis, and studfed the
needs of our so{l by simple tests as
nientioned. It is the object and de-
sire of the Tobacco Division to extend
the scope of this work and to give as-
sistance in planning. and carrying out :
the experiments with any grower who 3g
is interested to the extent of sabe SE :
to study the needs of his farm,

Simnniing up the results of the
periments briefly they have shown:

1, That the soll on which the kiln
dried tobacco is grown need all three
of the elements of plant food, namely:
often spoken of as am-
monia;-pliosphoric acid, the element
we 48 furnished in acid phosphate;

 

   
   
      
  
 

 

 
   
 

 
 

“potash.

That it js more economical, to
buy the nitrogen as 21% sulphate of
animonia or 13% dried blood; the
phosphoric acid as 16%, acid ‘phos-
phate; and the potash as 48% sulphate
of potash, and mix them at home. In
way the cost of fraight and:
hauling of a large amount of, filler is
avoided besides handling and dis-
distributing it on the farm. There is”
an educative feature of this mettod
of fertilizing as. well as material pro-

and quality’are very much improved
by the larger applications of sulphate

but at the present prices of potash 100

ANY people forget that a
hen requires feeds other
than grain in order to be in
good health and to lay.

All-grain rations are neither con:
ducive to health or egg production.
At times when hens haye the run of
the stables and tho yards, together
with house scraps, they do very well,

owing to the fact that an opportunity
is given them to pick up bits of
clover leaves, roots, und such like
material.

A certain amount of meat foods is
essential in order to produce the
white of the eggs. Too much of such
feed is apt to cause trouble with the
general digestion ofthe bird.

Frank Sarani,zRussian, of Walkerville, |
was arraigned in Windgor police court |
Thursday. Magistrate Miers ordered |
a remand for eight days, pending fur-
ther Investigation. “2

Victor Raper, Windsor; H. W. Bel-
ch@r, Brantford, and W. Gyons, Highs
gate, were appointed Thursday to the
customs staff’ at Windsor, They are}
returned soldiers with more “than
two years’ service to thelrcredit. Ac-
cording to, Inspector H. C, Blair, of
Ottawa, who administered the oath to
the néw. officers, all civil service vac-
anecles in future will be filled by re-
turned men.

At a salaryjof $2,500 a year, Captain
Asa Minard, chief inspector of the! Do-
minion polfée in We8tern-Ontario, has
been appointed permanent secretary
of.the Windsor branch of the Great
-War Veterans’ Assoclation. Captain
oMinard is’ now statfoned at London,
Ont. As secretary-of the yeterans’ or-
ganization, Captain” Minard’s duties
will includé the establishment of a
labor bureau, at Windsor, -~where. sol-
diers will, be assisted Back “to. civil
life, and“adVised as to what occupa
tion to follow,

Some idea of what $120,000,000,000
means is gained from; statistics com-
apiled by a statistician’ who estimates
that the bill_of Germany, paid at one
time, would require 241,897 one-ton
trucks to carry it, or the entire output
of the Ford truck factory fortwo years
and four months. With the trucks
srunning-at a speed of 20 mileg,an hour
it sould. be’ 80% hours before they
“passed a given point.«In a single line

the best animal feed known. It gives
the best results when sour. Whén
birds are accustomed to it they will
not take too much.

Beef scrap and high-grade tankage
are used very extensively on large
poultry plants where milk {s not
available, These are mixed with
ground grain, generally in the pro-
portion of fifteen to twenty per cent.
For the general purpose breeds the
former amount is sufficient, Breeds
such as Leghorns will make good use
of twenty per cent. of meat scrap in
the ration.

Cooked butchers’ meat, green cut
bone, cooked beef head, lungs, liver,
etc,, are all very good feeds and may
be fed in a manner similar to meat
scrap.

Some people think that because a
little of meat feeds are good, more
would be ‘better, Experience has
shown that such is not the case. Too
much often causes serious trouble.

Green feeds are cssential for
health and for economy, A hen
should have all the green feed she
will consume. A certain amount of
bulky, succulent green feed she will
consume. Such feed is usually falrly
inexpensive. Where birds are not fed
any green feed, in the course of time
they become unthrifty, lay poorly and
moreover, the eggs from such birds
many times are very low in hatching
power,

Experience has shown {hat oats
when properly sprouted are a most
excellent feed. *The hensware very
fond of them and the value of the
oats a8 a feed is good. That {s, the
sprouted oats reduce the grain’ feed
consumption equal to the pounds of
oats sprouted and one gains the in-
creased pilatability of the oats, as
well as the value from the greens.

Thin-leafed greens contiin oné of
the. very important @lements , of
growth and health, They are called
nature's, protective feeds; that is
they assist to maintain the birds’
health or normal_resistance against
disease. Health {5s “hn -essential to
profit. In winter we find such feed
in sprouted oats, cabbage, and clover
leaves.—Prof.\ R. W. Graham, O, A.
College, Guelph,

Value of Concentrates In Ration.

A cattle feed is valuable to the ex-
tent it contains those substances
which will repair body tissue,—build
new tissue and furnish energy to do
work, The particular materials in a
food which have this power are pro-
tein, “the flésh-forming substanoe,
carbohydrates and fat, the fat and
energy producers and the mineral
matter which has a great many fune-
tions in the body.

Any feed that carries a high per-
cénthge of protein. and fat and a
largé amount of a digestible form. of
the carbohydrates is called a concen-
trated feed or concentrate. Thus
grains, mill feeds and -oll cakes are
concentrites, On the othér. hand, a
fced!low in :these valuable constitu-
ents and high: in indigestible carbo-
hydrates, or crude fibre, as, for in-
stance, straw, hy, ‘corn stalks, are
called roughage*or bulky feeds. Roots
may also be put in this class because
they contain a very high percentage
of water-and they are for this reason
bulky. 3

These bulky feedg have, their place
in°the ration, indeéd in the case of
full-frown animals on maintenance
ration, they may form the whole of
the food; but it is impossible for a
yolns animal to make rapid growth,
a cow to give a large amount of milk
or a horse to, work hard on such
feed. The hard woody«fibre of the
straw and hay are difficult to digest
and much 6f the energy that should
go to production of work or increase
is used Up in digesting the food.
Consequently when production js de-
sired the atiount of roughage feed
must be reduced and the cencen-
trates increased.

Another redsen why concentrates *
must be used is that to get the ate
est production We must have the ani-
mal digest and @bgorb the maximum
amount of the yarious constituents

CETYLENB lighting is not-by
any means a new thing Jn
this country as there are
homes here and there in vil-

lage and countryside in which thir
system of lightning has been in use
for many years, Many improvements
have been made in the mechanism of
the plant, so that now this system
js considered to be absolutely safe
and reliable if it receives zeasonable
caro and attention. Thecost, of course,
is rather more since the war, but
even at the present price it is an in-
vestment that will return high divi-
‘dends, probably not always directly
in dollars and cents, but in better
health, more comfort, less labor and
Benuine satisfaction for those ibyine
in the home, because acetylene gas fin
burning produces less heat, consumee
less oxygen and forms less carbon
dioxide than kerosene, for example,
and makes a far more brilliant light
than even electricity, and it is ensier
on the eyes: It may also be
used for cooking in the house and It

is also well adapted for street light-
ing of villages and small towns,

The acetylene lighting plant con-
sists of a gas generator, gas service
piping, and gas jets or -chandellers.
The generators vary in size accord-
ing to amount of gas required, one
for the home being, of course, much
smaller than that required for a lirge
institution or village, The chief
parts of the generator are: Water
chamber, carbide holder, gas holder,
gas filter, gas washer, gas intake
pipe, feed pipe, safety vent, sludge
agitafor and automatic carbide feeder
device, .The generator for a home,
requires only a few square feet of
space, as it is very compactly con-
It is usually placed in the
basement, and it is very important
that it be kept safe from frost.

The operation of the plant fs as

CANADIAN NEWS. 4

The American: Agricultutist says
that as soon as hostilities ceased
steel prices’ were voluntarily reduced
by American manufacturers by from
$3 to $6 a ‘ton.’

A diplomat in the London Daily Ex-
press writes: “With Austria in the
German canfederation—I use this term
‘because the Empire may_. disappear
with the war—the Roman Catholics
will represent 54°per cent. of the
population and the Protestants AG per
cent, Unless,”*therefore, Austria be-
comes predominantly Socialistic the
Roman Catholic party, which has for
years turned the scales in the eke
an
the world may yet sée its leader, Herr
Erzgerber, the first President of a
Germap Republic.”

Lord Sands, speaking: in: Edinburgh, |
declared that among the causes of the
spread of betting and gambling was
the growth of the Popular Press. For

mitigation of the evil he suggested
that publication of the Press or othér-
wise of betting tips or bookmakers’
advertisements ‘should ‘be prohibited,
as also the publication of odds after
races. Newspaper. competitions for
prizes should ‘be prohibited where
there was entry money, and the print-
‘Ing for circulation of betting circulars,

slips or coupons, ought to. be made an
offence. *

Winter Care of Pregszant Mares,

Those who have had experience In
horse breeding have noticéd*that a
ronsiderable percentage of the spring
colts, vespecially those born ,before
the mares’ are on pasture, are weakly,
often not able to stand, and. souie-
times without sufficient ambition to
nurse when held up and the teat in-
traduced into the mouth. Lt will also
be observed that foals of this de-
scription aré usually those of dans
that have been pampered during the
winter months—those that hav- been
well fed, and kept in the stable most
of the time without exercise.

The pregnant ogre’should be well

fed and ‘given regular exercise or

light work, “The Idea that she should
not be well fed is not uncomnion.
The foetus is daily increasing in size.
This growth. dees not take place
without nutriment.*°The hutriment
mist be supplied by the blood ef the
dam, and; ts nutridient is not a nor
mal product of the blood, but ia sup-
plied by the food tie animal cats, we
can readily’ see that the pregnant
animal has not only her own tissucs
to nourish, but olso those of a grow-
ing foetus, which, in the later
months of gestation i6 no swall nial-
ter. Hence we.see that the pregnant
mare requires*moye food than her
non-pregnant sister of the same size
that is doing the sume work. Good hay
and oats are the foods to be relied
upun to: provide nourizhment, and
these should be fed in quantities.
proportionate *to the size of the ani-
mal and the grain in=proportion to
the amount of work or exercise given.
jn addition she should be given 4

TOBACCO SEED GERMINATION
TESTS,

 
 
 
  
      

 

For the past tw@ years germination
tests have been run with the seed for
the various varieties grown at -the
are folded over and the corners are
and’ the Harrow Tobacco Station, Har-
row, Ontario.

The tests in all cases were run in

duplicate on blue blotting paper some-
what heavier than the ordinary bdlot-
ting paper, The paper is cut into
2%" squares after which the edges
clips. This makes a ainall tray which
folded down and: held with paper
clips. This make sa small tray which
accommodates 100 tobacco seeds quite
nicely, Since tobacco seeds ore so
very small] and the surface of the seed
coat somewhat rough or pitted. they
can best be counted Op glass which {s
placed over a sheet of white paper,
with a piece of small wire or forceps
with curved points. The seed on the
smooth surface of the glass can be
readily counted into.lots of 100 gach.
The 100 seeds can be easily transfer-
red ‘with a small came)’s hair brush
from the glass to a plece of folded
paper which affords a ready means of
an even distribution on the germin-
ationi tray. The trays are tifen placed
on shallow pans which contain about
1” of rather fine. sand (ordinary
building sand 1s very good) previous-
ly mofsatened. Care should be taken
not (0 have the sand too wet. ‘The
pans which accommodate 24 trays, 12
tests in duovlicate, are then placed
into an incubator at a temperature of
24 degrees Centigrade or 75 degrees
Farenheit. At the end of the 6th and
14th days the counts are made and 4n
Most instances the test {s concluded }
at this date. In some instances the
seed are rétained until the count on
the 21st day, but those that do not
germinate™by the 6th and 14th days
are of practically no value. The re-
sults of past tests show that in many
cases where the seed Is good a very
vigorous. germination wil! take plage
in 6 days and the test even concluded
on that date. Still with the seed from
some varieties the maximum germin-
ation is not reached until the 10th and
Wth days.

The germinative ability or viability
of tobacco seed, like that.from many
other plants, varies a great deal, much
depending on the favorability of the
season while growing. No doubt a
great den! depends on the kind of
weather at thé time the polination of
the pistils of the’ flowers, If thé
weather is warm and favorable a much
higher percentage of viable seed are
set in the seed pods than under ad-
verse circumstances, all average of
60 tests with both 1916 and 1917 seed
gave nan average germination percent-
age of 78,3 and 66.2 respectively. Very
few germination tests have been run
on the 1918 seed but the percentage
seems to be’ very litfle better than the
1917 seed. This, however, should)

Spraying tobacco with either arsen-
ate of lead or Paris green is the moat
jeffective and economical method for
controlling the horn worm. By spray-
ing not o are all worms, on the to-
bacco killed but also all that hatch
within a week or ten days after spray-
ing.

‘or this purpose arsenate of lead -
has been found to be superior to Paris
green in that there {s more danger of
burning the tobacco with the latter;
the Paris green washes off more read- _
fly andi therefore its period of effact-
iveness is shorter;, and. too, if it is
necessary to spray several times, the <
Paris green seems to collect at a point i
where the leaf jolns the stalk, killing
the leaf tissue and either causing the
leaves to drop off in the field or.to ‘
break offymore easily when harvesting. ;

‘Arsenate of lead may be used either
In the form of a paste or a powder, ~
and may be applied either in solution
or dusted on the tobacto, If used in "

if the s of Canada are compelled
by temporary interruption to their ex-
port shipping to reduce the output of
flour, the output of bran nad shorts
will also, of course, be affected. A
proportion of bran and shorts 18 _be-
ing rejeased for export to the West
Indies, Central and, Southern Amer-
jca- and Newfoundland. Bran and
shorts {rom flour sold in Canada will,
‘of course, continue to be available at
the fixed prices already established.
The effect of the new regulation .will
be to afford relief to the flour millers,
without detriment to Caffadian far-
mers, asthe bran and shorts. allowed
to be exported would not be manufac-
tured unless an export. market was
found for the flour.

“Mother used to bake her bread,
Now she orders NEAL’S instead.
Folks all-find it just as good—

Nature’s own pure perfect food.”

Bunn the Baker of Bara-Boo.

Mrs. Friendly Sa

“Yesterday I had’tea with a modern young housekeeper and I said to her, are helped
7} 3
myself.to a generous buttered slice, ‘What a. treat to have home-made: bread,’
*

» “Do you like it better than your baker’s bread?” she asked.

“Like it!” I echoed. “Why there’s simply no comparison. Your bread makes me piec-
ture dear old mother taking great big, crusty brown loaves out of the oven, and cutting e
one, fresh and. warm, for us children to eat.” a.

The modern young housekeeper smiled as she said: “The old-fashioned woman used
tobe the world’s )aker. The modern woman is the world’s BUYER—she buys 90 per
cent. Of the products sold to-day. She has made it possible to buy bread that you can’t
tell from homnie-made.” _ : a

“Wihiat! Then you did’t make this?” : ,
“No, I bought it. So can you. It’s Neal’s MOTHER’S bread, and the Inbel fs a silent
guarantee of quality. The bread speaks for itself.” :

And, right away, I felt inclined to make a noise like ten dollars’ worth of tickets.
