Every abmarino bas its commander

are all thy machines that the confiict-
ing commads from more than ono off-
cer would ajrast surely result in an
accident; hence é¢ry ono reports di-
rectly to the captin through the’ sec-
ond officer in coamand, who, by the
way, is also respasible for the correct
operation of everthing from the bal-
lagt tanks to the orpedoes.

In making the attack the captain
mans the periscop in the main oper-
ating room, just baeath thé conning
tower, Tho lenses wd prisms in the
Periscope tube trawmit the images
from the sighting pice above the wa-
ter down to the pert<ope eyepiece.

When the vesss! dives the decks aro
first cleared. Then the hatches are
sealed down aid the ofl engines aro
stopped in quik succession. Storage
batteries are tuned on to drive the
electric propellug motors. Electric
machinery mut be used under water
because (he of] engines consume pre-
clous alr and exinust poisonous gases.

the ship on an even keel. This trim-
ming of the submarine, of course, can
be delicately controlled by the buoyan-
cy gauges and controls in the operating
room,

The weight of all this water causes
the submarine to sink, but not com-
pletely. The horizontal rudders at the
stern of the ship are used to give the
final touches to the dive The com-
mander directs the man at the wheel
how far down he wishes to go. By
watching the dept) gauges in front of
him the wheelman can so tip the div-
ing rudders that the proper depth can
be found Immediately and held exactly.

I¢ takes but a minute or two to dive.
In torpedeing a ship the vessel must
be turned to-alm the torpedo tubes,
which le parallel) with the central axis
of the ‘submarine—in the bow. Tho
command is given to fire. The gunners
in the forward compartment receive
the order through spenking tubes or

How to Prevent Bees Swarming—

to Destroy Troublesome Weeds,

HE statement that the mil.
ing machine has now be
come a practical proposal.
tion can now be made with

considerable confidence. Practically
all the standard makes of machines
sold in this province, the cheape:
ones as well as the moro expensive,
are giving good satisfaction in the
hands of a great many dairymen.

ut all machines are some
what complicated, and somewhai
delicate of adjustment, so that to be
successful the operator must exercise

some mechanical ability, and strict
care and attention to the needs of 1n-
dividual cows, Without these the
milking machine has'always proved
a failure, It can hardly be said that
the machine will get-as much milk
from the cows as good hand milking,
but properly handled, it will give
better results than the average hand-
milking, and there is no doubt of 'ts
being a great economiser of labor and
time, The machine has its place on
the farms of dairymen who niilk
more than ten cows, it being doubt-
ful economy to invest so much money
foy 2 smaller berd. It may also be
doubtful economy to instal the ma-

To Prevent Bees Swarming,

June is the swarming month and
time of supering for the main honey
flow which begins between the 10th
and the 20th of the month, depend-
ing on the geason and the latitude.
Be sure.to give supers enough to
avoid any crowding which may cause
the bees to become discouraged, quit
work aod “swarm excessively. Jt
should be the beekeeper’s aim id
prevent swarming as much as pos-
sible. This is done by keeping young
queens, giving plenty of room and
systematic examination of brood-
chambers to détect colonies whicn
are preparing to swarm. When queen
cells are found far adyanced they
should all be destroyed and the queen
herself removed. After the colony
hag-been queenless one week the
combs should again be examined and
all cells except one removed. This
One will provide them with a queen
and ‘if only one is left they will not
swarm again, Where an improvement
of stock is desir the new queen
may be given instead of leaving one
queen cell, *

Natural swarms should be’ hived on
the old stand after removing the
parent colony .to’one side, The
swarms should be given the supers
from the old colony. New swarms
work with great vigor because they
have no brood to care for during the
first week. Colonies held together
without swarming gather more honey
than those which swarm. It is the
beekeepers patriotic’ duty to reduce
the cost of honéy production and thus
increate the quantity he js called to
produce as greatly as possible. They
also cause the beekeeper less trouble
at unexpected times. This may be
done more by swarm prevention-than
in any other way. Bulletin 233 (On-
tario Department of Agriculture)
takes this matter up thoroughly and

should be carefully studied by’ all’

beekeepers. — Provincial -“Aplarist,
Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph.

Hints For the Gardener,

Thorough cultivation of tho soil
must be practised in the garden. The
common hoe, wheel hoe and the gar-
denscultivator should be kept going
immediately after each rain. » The
seed sown in the field should be thin-
ned’ carefully, &iving each plant the
amount of space required for good
growth. Use poison bran mash to

kill the cut worm, which will be ac-

tive at this season. The asparagus
bed should have the sécond applica-
tion: of 100 Ibs. ber acre of nittate
of soda. All stocks should be care-
fully cut even if they cannot be used:
Early celery, tomatoes and othor
tender plants should pe get out the
first of this month, Whilo’ citrona,
cucumbers, pumpkins and melons
should be planted. A §mall amount
of nitrate of soda around celery and
tomato plants four or five days after
setting out, will aid in their growtao.
The latter part of this qponth and
the beginning of DeXt, inte celery,
cabbage, cauliflower and kale are
transplanted into the feld.” Sowing
of corn and beans should be ‘made
every week during this month.

To Eradicate Bad Weeds; ;

If troubled with mustard in grain
crops, spray with thy 20 p.c, solution
of iron sulphate, (3 Ibs. of iron eul-
phate; to each gallon of water). If
such spraying js to be effective it
must be done sarily just when tho
first mustard: plants in the field are
coming into flower,

Potash-sulphur dusts dre not recom-
mended by the Ohio Experiment Sta-
tion for use in combination with ar;

NEW ORDER FOR FURLOUGH MEN

A new order regarding the dispo-
sition of married soldiers of the firat
contingent -in ~@anada on furlough;
was recelyed from Ottawa on Tues-
day. The order statesithat all married
men of the first contingent in Canada,

‘may be medically boarded by a medi-

cal officer, who will thoroughly exam-
ine the soldier and recommend to the
medical board that he soldier should
be ‘boarded and pificed in a new cute-
gory, All soldiers thus boarded, who
racelye A, Al, or B2 categories must
return overseas to» their regimental}:
depots before their jeave exp{ros, Any
soldier found to be categorized as C
will be transferted to the military po-
lice or to the garrison battalion, while
any man classed as D will be given
medical treatment tind disposed of,

PLANTING HINTS THAT :

: RAISE YIELD OF CORN
Drilled corn has yielded more than
that planted in hills when the same
amount’ of sead was used per acre in
teats conducted by the Ohjo Experti-
ment Station. For hill planting thre’
kernels per-hill has been the most/®
satisfactory rate:

An increased yield of three bushels
per dcre was harvested in favor of
drilled corn. Machine cutting” is
easier if corn is drilled, but for har-
vesting by hand the hil! method is pre-
ferred “by miost farmers. Cultivation
is. easier by the latter plan:

Four and five kernels per hill have
given slightly larger acre-yields than
a three-kernel rate, but the grain is
inferior in quality from such thick
planting on most sofls, With a
scarcity of seed corn, such as exists
this year, the planting of three kernels
in hills 36 inches apart or the drilling
of kernels 12 inches apart is to be
recommended to Ohio farmers. . Spac-
ing plants°10 inches apart {n the row
has ‘been found best for silage corn;
for, while the yield has been less than
from planting four inches.apart In the
row, the stalks are . able to resist
storms and make harvesting much

easier.

Consumption of wool for that purpose

same man at the front weara on an
‘Average of One hundred pairs of heavy
Wool gocks a year, each pain weighing

ut a half a pound. His wool con-

mption is therefore, for that article
of clothing fifty pounds per year, or
tilrty-threo times as much. Multiply
the difference in the individual con-
sumption of wool by the millions of
men in khaki, and a smali idea will
be obtained of the vast increase in
demand for wool. British War De-
Dartment #stimates showed in July
of 1917 that whereas the orders for
woo] socks for the army were in
1913-14 about 1,236,000 pairs, the or-
ders in 1917 would be 61,400,000, An
other item from the same source
shows that jn the three years before
the war, 165,000- pairs of blankets
Were issued 40 the army. In two years
and ten months after war commenced
the issue of blankets had jumped to
the immenge fotal of 11,874,000 pairs.
Considering tiie welght of the blan-
kets at seven pounds per pair, this
one item shows an increase in use
of wool of newrly 88,000,000 pounds,
And these are only two items out of
Many. The result-of this enormous
demand has caused tlie price to go up
by leaps and ounds until even to-
day with the gost of woo) yarn four
and 4 half times as high as it was in

  
 

1914, the tap price has not been
reached. The situation has become
acute, and jt has’ become , necessary

manufacture of new yarns for com-
merclal manufacturing, that will con:
tain a greater mer cent. of wool than
60, Standardizilion of cléths is being
followed in ,Biitain to-day, and all
lines of knitted or woven woollen
cloths or articlies will be ultimately
affected. -The wld phrase “all wool’
will be a lost term, if the present de-
mands continae: much longer.

A Silk,

Silk fs the tiiird of the raw mater-
lals to be touched an. It t dvane-
ed considerably; also,< showing the
Freatest advance betweon the seasons
of 1 and 1918. There are Various
reas for ‘this fact. The big
sources-of supmly of dyed silk fabrics

  

 

   
  

were France ‘and, Switzerland; ~ and
wii. France bearing her wonderful
sihare of the fighting, the manufac-

fture of luxuries has been materially
curtailed. Switzerland kept well up
for a time, but with the increasing
\@ifficulties of obtaining goods from
there, with the higher import duties,
i and carrying charges, a marked ad-
vance had to be placed on the original
cost in Switzerlandy Then. too, the
dificulty of getting the raw material
Inte Switzerland was equal to the
@\fficulty of getting the manufactur-
@d article out Japan has come rapid-
ity to the front, not only in the manu-
‘facture of the natural undyed silks,
but also In the dyed -lines, but the

way is long and transportation
charges tre henvy, and with the with-
|drawal by the Government of ‘the

“Empresses” from thé Pacific, carry-
ing conditions will be worse.

The advance in silks not so much
as in the case of Iinen or wool, elther
from the shottage of the new raw
Material nor so much from the great
| increase In the demand, but is in part

i .stricy manufactured problem,
(Dyes are extremély higher, Jabor is
higher, and there are the other rea-
Sons given above. . However, @k is
‘coming into greater ond.more popu-

Jar uge as time goes on. With the

impossibility of, getting satisfactory

wool goods. with the mixture of cot-
ton with wool in the yarns, and be
cause silk is’ not needed for the big
cause, the army, like the other ma-
terinis, Dome ,Fastilon, hus decreed
the use of :sifk.to a much larger de-

Sree, and, as {s always the case; with

the greater demand, comes the higher

Cotton.

“Cotton is King,” an old adage anil
Whe bellef of the South, is just about

wasted — the garbage of “our towns
and citlea,

This is the>evidence given by a
commission appointed by the Agri-
cultural Section of the Ontario Or-
giuization of Resources Committee,
to investigate the feeding of garbage

to swine. The commission consisted
of J. B, Brethour, Burford; F. W.
Johnson, Walkenville, and Justus
Miller, Toronto. These gentlemen
have lately returned from’a tour of
American cities where garbage is fed
to hogs and are of the opinion that
Ontario ought not to delay longer in
the matter, ,

The salient points of the report
which has been prepared regarding:
thelr findings are brielly; (1) That
garbage has a food value of between
$8 and $9 a ton; (2) that it should
be fed entirely untreated, Le, that
it should not, be heated; washed or
sorted; (3) that residents of towns
and cities where garbage is to be fed,
mnust separate their garbage, placing
table refuse only in a separate con-
talner;,; (4) that for every 100,000
of population a minimum of 6,000
tons of garbage is produced each
year, which will feed 3,000 hogs;
(5) that the double treatment (se-
rum and virus) for hog cholera must
be given to make the plan feasible.

A Smaji percentage of our garbage
has been fed to hogs already but tne
regulations of the Federal Veterinary ],
Director-General tompelled feeders
to sterilize girbage by the boiling ar
steaming process and prohibited the
immunizing of hogs by the double
treatment against cholera, Since ré-|f)
turning to Canada thé investigating
committed has taken the matter up
-with Dr. Torrance, however, and has
secured bis permission to allow un-
treated garbage to be fed and hogs
to be given the double treatment,
subject to very reasonable conditions,

PROSPECTS BRIGHT
FOR TOBACCO GROWERS

 

 

Since the budget speech of Hon. A.
K, McLean, Acting Minister of -Fin-
ance, there has been a good deal of
discussion and ‘misapprehension am-
ong growers of tobacco, as to the ef-
fect the® proposed regulations may
have on the price of their produce the
coming season. To begin with, as T
understand ft. The Government pro-
poses to increase the excise duty on
manufactured tobacco, both foreign
and domestic, from ten . cents per
pound (the! present excise) to twenty
cents per pound and to raise the im-
port duty on forelgn tobacco from
twenty-eight cents per= pound (the
present import duty) to forty cents
per pound. It is also proposed to col-
lect. from the farmer growing tobacco
In Canada five cents per pound. The
reagon, I presume, for collecting this
five cents per.pound from the farmer,
instead of collecting the entire twen-
ty-flve cents from the manufacturer
of Canadian tobacco, is that a great
deal of tobacco 15 retailed through the
stores in the unmanufactured or-riw
state, This is the case especially in
Eastern Canaua find heretofore «the,
Government has. received no revenue
whatever from his tobacco as It does
not go through any factory. Now let
us consider what effect the proposed
regulation will, if enacted into law,
have_on the market for. .Canadian
grown leaf tobacco,, The excise duty
on both foreign and home grown to-
bacco is to be the same, thesimport
duty-on forelgn tobaceo {s to be forty |’
cents instead of twenty-elght cents as
at present—an’ increase of twelve
cents per pound, and after the domes-
tle article. paya five cents at the farm

Growersts tony gree eels te tne

5 ¢ents

Total
Therefore the domestic product;has
36 cents protection per potnd instead
of 28 cents as heretofore. The prob-
wbility that fivercents per pound) may
be collected from the grower doesn’t
mean by any means that the grower)
will lose it. The Manufacturer to
whom he sells ‘will, undoubtedly, pay
him five cents per pound more than
he would have paid otherwise and will
in turn pass the charge along toi the
Pultimate consumer. For instance, wé

four hundred’ acres of Snuff, Zimmer
and Connecticut Havana tobacco nt
prices from 15% to 24 cents per pound
for first class quality, ind we are now
writing the parties with whom we
made these contracts that they will
be paid the full contract price and in
addition thereto we will pay, any ,tax
that may be imposed. The same line
fof ‘procedure- will apply to. tobacco
that is to be bought-in the fall, that {s
if the grower has to pay any tax, the

sumer. The leaf tobacco market in
Canada is bare and {it séome cortain

that prices’ will”be high the coming

season for,all that can be Sroduged.

OF THE PROVINCIAL BOARD OF HEALTH,

HERD aro five chief ways in which disease spreads. These aro:
Water, Food, Flies, Milk, and Contact. These sources of {nfection
are intermingled with one another. Let us look into them and
seo how disease travels from one person to another.

» The source of all water supply comes from the rain and
snow. Next we find it in rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes, stored in the
ground in the form of springs, and in underground stretches of gravel

whence it is obtained from deep or shallow wells. When a water supply

is being considered it must be judged (like tho character of a
WATER person) by the company it keeps, Any source of water supply

cannot be pure if it is exposed to the entrance into it of sewage
(the discharge from the bodies of human beings). This may occur.in a
variety of ways; for example, a stréam, river, or lake which would other-
wise be pure, may have tho sewage of a town dumped into it, or thors may
be water-closets upon its banks, or the excreta of a typhoid case miy be
thrown on the ground nearby and washed by melting snow or rain into the
water. A supply from,such a source, unless purified, is a dangerous one., It
might be safe for every day of the year but ome; the pollution on that ono
day might start an epidemic of disease. The well may be unprotected),
allowing surface water to enter, or it may be sunk in a creviced! limestone
rock which serves as a means whereby Sewage may reach the water. ,The
eommonest diseases carried by wator are Typhoid Fever, Cholera, Dyséntery,,.
and Diarrhoea (or Summer Complaint). In this country the commonest
water-borne disease is Typhoid Fever. ;

Food frequently carries diseaso because it becomes contaminated
FOOD by files, dirty fingers, and by mouth or nose-spray of carriers or

persons affected by disease. Meat containing the germs of tuber-
culosis or the larvae of certain worms, if insufficiently cooked, may carry
disease, 5

Flies breed in manure, chiefly in fresh horse manure. © They will not
breed in fermenting manure, which is too hot for them. A period of eight
to eleven days {is required to carry the fly from the egg stage through the

maggot, larvae, and pupae stages to the full grown_fly. The fly
FLIES will not travel great distances if there {s plenty of food at hand,

but if hungry it may fly for some distance, say half a mile or more,
One can easily understand how this insect may\carry disease when one con-
aiders its well-known habits of flitting from the exposed contents of the
wator-closet to food in the kitchen. Diseases such as Typhoid, Dysentery,
Cholera, Diarrhoea, and Tuberculosis are commonly carried by flies,

By milk from tuberculous cows children may become infected with
Tuberculosis; or, if the hand’er fis a consumptive, the disease may be car-
ried to the users. Similarly, if those handling milk are in contact
with diseases Ilke Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria, these diseases may
be carried. Washing of cans with sewage-polluted water, or dilution
of milk with polluted water may serve to infect the milk; and, in turn, the
consumers with water-borne diseases. h

Contact with either the actual victims of diseases like Tuberculosis
and communicable affections, or with “carriers” of such diseases is a very
common means of infection. Those who come, closest in contact with
sufferers from communicable diseases are the greatest victims,
‘Thus in cases of Diphtheria the mother, the nurse, and the
doctor suffer infection in the order named. It used tobe
thought that Tuberculosis’ was inherited because members of the same
family often died one after the other. Now tt is_well understood that Tuber-
culosis is’a “Catching” disease and that it is the close contact between the
members of the family, living, eating, sleeping together, using the samo
table utensils and the same towels, which is the cause of the terrible family
mortality from this disease. The better this is known the better is the
chance for prevention of Tuberculosis.

These, facts about the manner fn which disease. {8 spread should be
taught to every child. The school teachers might do well to lave ev

learn such facts very quickly. The knowledge of the growing population
about these matters is the hopo and the standby of the public health
