Premiums are not
- good value now

We've given them up—until after the war anyhow. There is
a far better way to give you value for your money and we've
done it—we've made the Comfort Soap bar much bigger.

New bigger Comfort bar is better value 3

Many of the Premiums—books, glassware) toys, jewelry, etc., used tq come from

Europe. These cannot be shipped now on account of the war, and the prem-
jums we can still get are either sv poorly medo or s0 expensive that the value simply isn't
there. The best way outis to give you all tho value of the premium in the biggest-selling
soap in Canada—that's Comfort. The Comfort bar is bigger now—at the same price.

Of course all wrappers, coupons, ete., now out in the
stores will be redeemed oo heretofore—but get them
in early while our Premius stock is still good. If
the new bar ion’t in stock yet, the old one is juct as
good yalue—with our present premiums.
