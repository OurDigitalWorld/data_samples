Premier Dominian of Canada 1896—1911.

“Sir Wilfrid Laurier died at 2,30 this afternoon.” “This message. flashed
t-om Ottawa Monday threw.the whole Dominion fnto mourning and lowered
to half mast the flags on every public building from coast to coast,. To the
public it came like a bolt from a blue sky, as only in the larger centers was
it-known that the Veteran Chieftain, whose long public life shed such lustre
upon the country he loved so wel), had suffered a stroke of paralysis Sunday.
On Saturday the old chieftain had a fainting spell from which, however, he
never recovered. On Sunday when dressing for church he had another and
lay down. Reluctant to adm{t-to-himself the seriousness of his edndition,
he strove to rise when the dinner gong rang. It was apparent at that moment
that the effusion of-blood flooded the brain and paralysis struck him. He lost
consciousness .and 4t was realized that his case was critical: However, he
recovered again, and toward midnight Was again conscious and had apparently
improved. A second stroke and a more serious one, came about twelve and
hope of his recovery was then abandoned’ Occasional flashes of conscious-
ness marked his condition thereafter in°th@ course of which he conversed
fitfully with’ those anound. .Towards the end he sank into unconsciousness
and denth came peacefully.

The body pf the. beloved ex-Premier will He inestate in the Housoof
Comnions until Saturday morning when the oagket will be taken to Sacred
Heart church, Ottawa, where mass will be said by Archbishop Mathicu, of
Regina-an intimate friend of the late late Opposition leader. Throughout the
country respect will be paid to his memory by places of business * closing
curing’ the hour of his funeral. :

The Right Honorable Sir Wilfrid Laurjer was born at St.-Lin, Quebec,
Fon November 20th, 1841, graduated from McGill in*1864, entering the practice
of Jaw; began his political career dm 1871, when he entered the Provincial
Legislature as member for Drummonil and Arthabaska, for which constituensy

when/his Governniént suffered defeat at the polls with tle proposed recl-
procity treaty with the United States as tlfe paramounteasue. In his younger
Gays Sir Wilfrid seryed in the volunteer militia, being an ensign in the
Arthubaskaville infantry company from 1869 to 1878, during the last Feninn
Rald, for which he wore a’medal. The notable achievements of the Laurier
regime were the granting of the preferential tariff for British products, grant~
ing an autonomy to the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Albérta;~ participa-
tion of Canada with British forces in the South African war, and inauguration
of the G: T. P. Transcontinental Railway scheme. The defeat of Sir Wilfrid
Leuers party on the conscription issue in 1917 is still fresh in the public
mind. a age

The daily papers of al! shades of politics vie with one another in paying
tribute to Canada’s pyemier statesman. He occupied a place so large in the
country that 1s {s Almost impossfble to conceive that Canada can get-along
without him. His logs overwhelms the Liberal party, who loved him and pay
*ribute to his career ag the most remarkable of the century. His life was so
éonspicuous that it shiies with a glow tliat can néver be effaced. His first
cabinet of Provincial’ Premiers in 1896 was the greatest combination? of in-
tellect and political {6Fce in any cabinet since Confederation, and under, their
influence Canada awakened, from the lethargy that bound {t and became a
nation. His Prejniership will always be referred to as the “Golden Period”
in the history of Canada. Laurier pled all his life for peace and toleration and
syen his politica) opponents’declare that through dll the storms of passion
and prejudice, he was the one outstanding consistent public man in Canada

 

   

tvcho retained hig composure and remained loyal to his convictions, and his-

tory will shoy {hat his course averted a racial conflict at a time when the
fate of Great Britain and Canada was hanging in the balance. Every one
ylelds respect to.Sir Wilirid Laurier for his unfailing devotion to the unity

In orchards which ar¢ thoroughly’

nitrogen. This advice is particularly
applicable to vineyards, and all other
fruits which run very strongly to

economy to apply the manures to the

Katherine frowned with displeasure
4s she turned to the first story In the
Magazine the postman had just
broight. The story with her own
named: the top in large letters under
the tith had been illustrated as she
had fered by Julian Fletcher, and.
Julian Fetcher had managed to spoil
the Jost 1alf dozen or so of her contri-
butions @ the National,

Other prople raved about his work,
and did it stop to insist’upon the
fuct, as d{ij the author, that an illus-
tration shoild stick to the context.
When a gilli is suid to come down a
sairwny In 4 queenly gown of velvet
and spangyes it is maddening to see in
the Illustrallon a debonair lass tripping
lightly down the steps In a frothy cren-
Uon of juvenii® Mes and a sush. Also
When one deserib¢s a wroine as hnav-
ing raven locks and dark, soulful eyes,
{t is the veriest heresy to have ‘her

| reproduced In a picture with rather

fluffy hair of an indiscriminate yellow
and eyes of gray with an unn/stakable
sense of humor that compelled one who
fazed to smile back in answering sym: |
pathy.

Just now the Iady represented in the
pleture was supposed to be a haughty
Person who prided herself on her
knowledge of clothes. Also she was
6upposed to bé alighting from her
limousine and drawing back in startled
horrér os shv saw approaching the one
person in the world she was trying to
avoid. .

But instead of horrified haughtiness,
the artist had sketched In an expres-
slon of rather ‘glorified naughtiness,
There ogain was an expression that
rather refused to take life seriously.

“If,” sald Katherine,- “that man
wants to be a buffoon, how does {t comgy
he's engaged to spoil perfectly serious
stories? I’m going to write to the
editer and tell him that if he wants
uny more stuff of mine he’s got to hunt
ee {lustrator.”

She looked again into the eyes of the
| girt who was intended to be soulful.
In spite of herseff she smiled back.
Then happening to look up into her
own Inlrror, she was startled, Her own
eyes looking back at her froin the
glass were the exact counterpart, of
those on the page. And her hair, wavy
and caught back loosely from her face,
with its:part on one side, was exactly
like that of the girl in the picture.
Then she caught up another picture,
and another, and studied them, long
and carefully. Then she took another
inventory of herself.

Slowly the bright color mounted to
her cheeks, and her breath came hard.
The pictures in the magazihe were of
her, there wasn't a doubt of it. And
now I{t came back to her gradually that
she had heard people say they had no-
-ticed a resemblance. And the dress in
the stairway picture was certainly
hers, and the rather youthful knock-
about suit of the MmousineIady who
waa, Supposed . to know ‘how to dress,
was @-replica of her own blue jersey.
And the hat!

Katherine grew thoughtful.
vengeance could she wreak upon Jul-
pian Fletcher, who, evidently knowing
her by eight, had had his own little
joke at her expense, But alas—even
while planning vengeance, the gray-
blue eyes, like those of the limousine
Indy, rather lacked the hardness es-
sential torreal vendetta.

She tossed” back her head finally,
haying reached at least a ‘partial dey
cision, that is, in omer to settle. her
account with one artist she must niake
up the difference ehe had had with an-
other. Jerry Page, her. erstwhile en-
emy, would now be essential to the
fulfillment of her gcheme and she

must make up with him right away. ,

Poor Jerry! After all it was too’ bad
the way she had treated him. She
never dreamed she'd migs him so much
until he had ceased. to come. In the
old’days he had a way of giving three
quick knocks and sticking in his head
the, password.
Who goes there?” |

If she wa4 busy, she'd call out,
“Kate.” And he would softly close the
door and vanish,

But if she called out, huskily, “A |

great blg bear!” he would let the rest
of himself in, his pockets crackling
suspiciously With parcels from the
delicatessen across the atreet,

Then Kathering would lay = cloth
and they wonld have lunch together.
Sometimes when he had sold a picture
and she had 89/4 9 stoty they would
go to dinner st a big hotel and to a
theater to celébrate. 5

Lately, hdwever, Katherine had sold

“Perhaps you are his {deul.*- Most

“But he husn't got me into his head.

But I love you, Kate, and I want you.
And in all your dear storles I see only

the Judges.

No doubt, the greatest benefit to
the canine race Is being accomplished
by those dog fanciers, who are mem-
bers of the kennel clubs and, almost
In every case, interested in hench

side being sentimentally inclined in
favor of the dof have a proper con-
ception of what a “dog of any breed
really should be, and it is to these
persons that it should be left to de-
elde the fate of the kind of dof that
is a general or particular nulszanco,
As a niatter of fact, they have nl-
rendy decided the question and are
moving as _rapidly as possible in the
right direction by encouraging the
breeding of good dogs such as will be
of such intrinsic value that thelr pro-
per care and management will be
assured,

“A place for everything and every-
thing in its place” applies to dogs
most particularly, and the majority
of owners of good dogs are the first
to admit this. The keeping and breed-
ing of good dogs (purebreds) should
be encouraged more strongly than at
Present, if anything. The cur may he
a good dog in some senso but his
reproduction should not be encour-
aged because, without any record of
his pedigree, how is one to form any
opinion of what his offspring is-go-
ing to turn out. It would be an’ in-
justice™to the-owner to remove his
pet cur by any means/whatever, £0
long as the animal 4s kept. within
reasonable bounds, but with the nn-
tural demise of the particular speci-
men his family aout cease to exist.
To insure such-an arrangement: legis-

A Useful Bulletin.

A most comprehensive bulletin on
| bacteria is that prepared by D. Hi.
| phe B.S,A., and published recently
by the Ontario Department of Agri-
culture. The treatise includes # defi-
nition of bacterin in general, giving
pee idea of the average size of the
more common species and the four
| typical shapes in which the miscro-
scopic forms of life appear. Methods
of bacterial growth, multiplication
| and°moyement are described, and the
Many species of bacteria, both bene-
ficial and. harmful, are grouped and
discussed under, the following heads:
| Bacteria of the Soil and Manure Pile,
Water Supply,. Food Preservation,
Sewage Disposal}.Milk and Milk Pro-
ducts, Infectious Diseases of-Man and
Animals, Diseases. of Plants. In his
pintroduction to the discussion of the
subjeét under the above heads the
author says:~"In addition to . those
bacteria which cause disease being
injurious, there are some which are
beneficial in one place-but injurious
in’ another. ..For instance,” many of
‘the species of ‘bacteria beneficial in
the soil are injurious when they get
onto food material, a8 they bring
about the decay» of putrefaction of
the food, rendering it unfit for use
if they are allowed to develop and
multiply on it. or in it.’ For. this
reason, he explains, the title of the
bulletin, “Bacteria: Friends ana
Foes,’*is adopted. Exact and ample
| illustrations aid.the reader in under-
standing the text. Thé bulletin’ is is-

REPORT OF THE SURBURBAN AREA ROAD COMMISSONERS.

qo the Warden and Members of Essex County Council:—
Gentlemen,—During the past yerr wo have not done any permanent road

sete: oak Mo the way of concrete culverts and a steel bridgeover Little
{yer on Road No. 8. And attached hereto you will find an { J
5, construction and maintenance. temizedstatement

As many of the suburban roads are worn out, wa woul
pormanent construction be started this year, and would pagent in
appropriate as much as you can for permanent improvement within the
suburban area, Our {den would be to continue a concrete road fom Pilette
Corners Jn Sandwich Bast as far oa possible, and we think that a dart should
giso be made on the Huron Line in Sandwich West. While we must admit
that the road known as the Gravel Road is possibly the main road and needs

new congtruction, Wo are In hopes that the Government will assune it as a
Provincial Highway, and thus relieve us.

In conclusion we wish to make mention of the position of te City of
Windsor withthe County in reference to the payment for the maintenance
and construction of the roads jn the Suburban Area. We are fald by the
Clerk that he, as required, rendered to the City a bill for the weck done in
7916 and 1917, also a statement of the estimated amount’ required for 1918.
hut the Treasurer tells up that up to date the City of Windsor had not paid
anything. We would therefore suggest and recommend that the County
Council take such steps as are necessary to collect from the City of Windsor

the amounts due by the City to tiie County for the maintenance and construc-
tion on the roads within the Suburban Area,

SS te a ae a he a a Me a i te Oe a a ca i a a a |

ANSWERS TO ROAD QUESTIONS,’

 

 

_A subscriber submitted a list of
questions relative to the good. roads
movement. These are here answered
by WeA. McLean, Deputy Minister of
Highways: , :

“The general intention of the Pro-
vinclal) Highways, Act is that each ; +
municipalfy shail pay 30 per,cent:
of the expenditure’ within {ts boun-
dary, but where a road was a County
Road previous to {ts*designation as
a Provincial Highway, the cost may
be levied upon the County as a
wholé. ‘It is the Intention of the De-
partment that for ordinary construc-
tion, the entire 30 per cent. will be
levied upon the municipolities; ex-
cept where, because: of special a
stractionidesired by the property an:
ers-Or of special benefit to them, there
shall be’ an amount levied upon the
property so benefitted, to defray the
extra cost.

“The question of a frontage tax has
received the attention of the Depart-
ment, but the general experience in *
the United States has been that the
cost of levying such a tax ambunts: to
more than the advantage gained. The
land along such a highway naturally
increases in value.. The assessment
Act of the Province provides that the
assessors shall in. consequence in-
crease the assessmént of such prop- ”
erty. which Increased assessment, will
be required to pay ita proportion of
taxation for all municipal purposes.
In this way farms. along the highway -
will, it is believed, be fairly levied up-
on for the benefits derived,

“Cities are requirédsto contribute 30
per cont. of the cost of construction
within their limits. ‘

“The Toronto-Hamilton Highway is
a case for special consideration, ow- —
ing to the value of farm lands ad-—
jacent to the road ranging from $300
to $1,000 per acre. An amount of
$4,000’ per mile has been apportioned =~
to property benefitted, but the distance
from the road to which this will apply
hag not yet been determined. ,
“In 1918, 8.000 feet of 16-ft. con-
crete pavement was constructed ad-
Jjacent to Walkerville as a main high-
way for the sum of $29,640.82, or $19,-
66294 per mile, ~~ 2 pote

“On the Provincial highways, the
cost of maintenance is distributed im

REPORT OF THE SURBURBAN AREA ROAD COMMISQONERS.

qo the Warden and Members of Essex Codnty Council:—

Gentlemen,—During the past year wo have not done any
puilding except in the way of concrete culverts and a steel b
juver on Road No. 8, And attached hereto you
of construction and maintenance,

As many of the suburban roads are worn out, we would sugy
permanent construction be started this year, and would suggest hat soc
appropriate as much as you can for~permanent {mprovement within the
suburban aréay. Our. idea would be to continue a concrete road from Pilette
Corners in Sandwich Hast as far as possible. and we think that a stay should
elso be made on the Huron Line in Sandwich West. While we myat admit
that the road known as the Gravel Road is possibly the main Foad and needs

new construction, we are in hopes that the Government Will assume it as a
provincial Highway, and thus relieve us. i

Pernanent road

ridge ayer Little
will find an itemized fatement

In conclusion we wish to make mention of the position of the Gity of
Windsor with the County in reference to the payment for the miintenance
and construction of the roads in the Suburban’ Area, We are told by the
Clerk that he, as required, rendered to the City a bill for the work done in
1916 and 1917, also a statement of the estimated amount required for 1918.
hut the Treasurer tells up that up to date the City of Windsor had not paid
anything. “We would therefore suggest and recommend that the County.
Cownoll take such steps as are necessary to collect from the CIty’ of Windsor

the amounts due by the City to the County for the maintenance and construc-
tion"on, the roads within the Suburbiin Area, E

Respeatfully submitted,

ANSWERS TO ROAD QUESTIONS.
a bem rertecr= od

A subseriver submitted a list of
questions relative to the good roads
movement, These are here answered
by: W. A. McLean, Deputy Minister of
Highways: Se

“The general intention of the Pro-
yincial Highways Act <is that each
municipality shall pay 30 per cent, .
of the expenditure within its* boun- *
dary, but where a road was a County
Roads previou# tg its designation as
a Provincial Highway, the cost may
be levied upon the County as a
whole. It is the inténtion of the De-
partment that for ordinary construe-
tion, the entire 30 per cent. will be
levied -upon %the ‘Municipalitiés; ex-
cept where, “because of special con-
struction desired by the property own-
ers or of special benefit to them, there
shall be an amount levied upon the
Property so benefitted, to defray the
extra cost. .

“The question of a-frontage tax has
teceived the attention of the Depart-
ment, but the general experience in
the United States has been that the
cost of levying such a tax amounts to
mqye than the’ advantage gained. The
land along such a highway naturally
increases in value, The assessment
Act,of the Province provides that the
assessors shall in consequence {n-
crease the assessment’ of’ such prop-
erty. which increased assessment will
be“ required to pay {ts proportion of
taxation for all municipal purposes.
In*this way farms along. the highway
will, it is believed, be fairly levied up=
on’ for the benefits derived.

“Cities are required to contributé 30

per cent. of the cost of construction
within their limits,

“The Toronto-Hamlilton. Highway is
& case for special consideration, ow-
ing. to the value of farm lands. ad-
jJacent to the road ranging from $300
to ‘$1,000 per acre. An amount of
$4,000" per mile has been apportioned
to property benefitted, but the distance
from the road to which this will apply
has not yet been determined. ~

“In 1918, 8,000 feet of 16-ft. con-
crete pavement was constructed ad-
jacent to“Walkerville as a main high-
way for the sum of $29,640.82, or $19,-
662 94 per mile, :

Corn Binder Is Time Saver.

With a corn binder and three
horses in.corn that is standing~well,
three men, one to drive and two to: :
shock, can harvest about twiee as fe
much as when cutting by hand. From 3
seven to nine acres can be cut in a
ten-hour day with a binder. The
same three men could scarcely cover ;
more than four acres in the same
length of time when cutting by hand.

With the binder they-can cut and
shock a 40-acre field of corn in a
week of less, effecting a big saving
in time, though perhaps none fi ex-
pense. The binder delivers the corn
in bundes, which f akes it Pa
ably casier to both in loading
on Wagons and at ‘he canilage chee :
ter. If your acreage in corn is not
large enough to justify an investment

%

cannot be done, rent a binder—it will:
take the place of one hired man in
cutting and shocking, or two in cut- ~
ting corn for ensilage.

Tile Drainage in Essex and Kent costs only 30 ver Gent. more now than before the

war, in fact only 30 per cent. more now-than it did 26 years.ago. Yet labor has gone
up 500 per cent. and fue} has gone up 1500 per cent. in the last 25 years. Farm pro-
duce, wheat, oats, corn, beef, pork, eggs, etc., have gene up 400 to 1000 per cent. in the
same length of time.

Tile makers have been patriotic. When everyth > else was doubling in price we
held our prices down although we were months behind in orders. We were offered
more money for tile, but we filled our orders in rotation. Wewere getting cheap gas
to. burn out tile, and the farmer got the benefit, net us.

 

The cost of tile making has more than doubled singe 1914, yet underdrainage only
“costs 30 percent. more. Underdrainage was Never cheaper and will he more expens-

Corn Binder Is Time Saver.

With a corn binder and three
horses in corn that is standing well,
three men, one to drive and two to

‘| shock, can harvest about twice as

much as when cutting by hand. From
seven’to nine acres can be cut in a
ten-hour day with a binder. The
same three men/could scarcely cover
more than four acres in the same
length of time when cutting by hand,
With the binder they can cut and
shock 2 40-acre field of corn in 2

:] week or less, effecting a big saving

fn time, though perhaps none in ex-
pense, The binder delivers the corn
{n bundes, which makes it consider-

ably easier to handle both in loading
on wagons and at the ensilage cut-
ter. If your acreage in corn is not

large enough to justify an investment

|} in a modern corn harvester, join with
Jone or two of your neighbors and

purchase one co-operativelys - If this
cannot be done, rent a binder—it will
take the place of one hired man in
cutting and shocking, or two in cut-
ting corn for ¢nallage:
