THE BAZAAR.

 

 

The bazaar [eld last week in tho
Parish Hall, Apherstburg, in aid of
the Improvemer!’ Fund of St. John
the Baptist chur¢} was successful be-

yond all expectatens. {t was thought
that owing to “be inopportune timd

and the bad qndition of the ronda,
many would have little money to spend
and more would be unable to attend,
but if great numbers were not al-
ways present, there was never any
‘ack of enthusiasm, and evidently those
who patronized the affair came pre-
pared to spend and to spend lavishly.
The receipts were boosted consider-
ably by the lake captaina, whd not
only worked but fairly turned their
purses inside out to help the cause.
Then, too, iirunner Mond did its
share, as us\il as did a groat many
of the citizens and the country foll,
who braved the bad roads to donate
and to spent, The -chicken supper,
prepared by Mrs, Callam and the
ladias assisting her, proved a strong
drawing cari. It did much to pack

$2,000. ‘The pistor I6 very grateful

To the Editor of The’ Echo:—

Dear Sir,—In the {ssue of your paper
of the 10th Inst,;4n commenting on the
reswit. of the vote on the’ Brunner.
Mond by-law, the item remarks “that
rit ig to be regretted that the by-Ihw
was defented,”etc.,, and that “the Com-
pany and council-should get together
{and have another vote,” etc. Is is not
an unheard of proceéding to advise an-
other vote being taken on the’ same
question, almost. before the ballots
have had time todry? Tf the vote hind
been otherwise, would anybody have
advjsed another yote being taken to
consider the same question? ‘The
question would bée»~settled for 10
years and left so. There was oa repre:
sentative vote polled—285 owners,
shows that the peoplo were intereSted.
In the past the councils of Anderdon.
and the ratepayers were always. com-
petent to settle any matter that came
before them. ‘Why so solicitous for
their welfare now?

The Brunner, Mond ~ Company. are
well acquainted with the improve-
ments contemplated in their plant
within the next ten years. “Is it fair to
ask the Township of Anderdon to bind
fhemeelves to a fixed assessment for
that perfod, not knowing what! the
im] rovements vill be? The councila
in the past have m t the Company
fairly in everything that they asked,
Why so afraid of the future?

Al¥ municipa} councils appoint their
‘Agsessors.at the beginning of the
yeitr; Anderdon will probably,-do so
this year. If the Brunner, Mond think
that they are assessed too high, they
can appeal to the-local court of revis-
fon, then to the County Judge, and-if
Not satisfied with his decision, then to
the Ontario Raflway and Municipal
Board. ‘And if any ratepnyer thinks
they (the Company) are not assessed
at actual value he has the same privi-
lege through the same channels,
Would it not be advisable to htve the
pancnar ent determined in, this man-
ner
