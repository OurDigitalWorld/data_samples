knew that after a consultation of Dr.

Dr, Dewar, of Wiindsor, it was dec!d-
ed to remove her to Harper hospital
for. en operation,, which was done
Monday, and Tuesday morning when
she was being prepared for the oper-
ation it was found that her condition
was such that she couldn't stand the
anaesthetic. Further treatment. wos

MAJOR DOE'S LECTURE.

Amherstburg paid oa great complj-
ment to Rev. ‘NMajor Edward -Doe, re-
turned chaplain,*6n Friday evening of
last week, by crowding the town hall
to the doors to Msten to hia thrilling
recital of three years’ lifé at the
front, as chaplain of one of the Can-
adian divisions. The address was un-
der the auspices of the focal K, of ©,,
and P, A, Barron was chairman, Fr,
Doe was accorded a warm. hearted re-
ception: before the concert ‘by a large
number of Amherstburg citizens and
surrounding him on the platform were
Wr. Ryan, Moyor Park, Judge Drow-
gole, W, T. Wilkinson,/Dr. ©. J. Pork,
bk. Bertrand, Mr. Ke Supt. Home

Reaume gaya ai  charaetoristicity-
humorous address, and, Mayor Park
rextended an address of weltome, while
a short address was aiso made by His
Honor Judge Droingole,

Major Doe's address was an epic in
personal recollections réjateji in a
thrilling manner, which’ held the rapt
attention of tho Jarge idience for
over an hour in spellbound expecta-
Uon. There was no bjood and. thun-
der, but a calm, eareful chronological
reci{nal of fhe war's progress’ as he
had experiénced it during his three
years in military service, from his

‘| leaving Canada sn the greatest of nll
Armadas, to the day he returned. His
vivid description of pleces he “had
Served in, the experience of the Can-
adinns with the vario gnses and
hates of the Bosches; his miraculous
encapes from death in its varied forms
caused shudders, to run’ through his
audience, while the teara were very
near as he pictured the burial of our
dead heroes, and the grout care tak-
on to mark their graves for all time to
come. -

At the conclusion sf Tri Doe's stir-
ring address, Mr. ‘Aujit moved a
hearty vote of thanks) both-to him
ond those who particxpated in the
program, which was gswzonded by Rev.

A BRIGHTER AGPECT.

The whole aspect of the war be-|,

comes suddenly brighter. The Aus-
trian assault on Italy, which, in the
gloom of a week or 60 ago, it was
predicted. might result in victory
and ay invasion of Southern France,
has ended {n a’great disaster. Aus-
.tria is presented in the despatches
a8 on the brink of’an inevitable revo-
lution, and Germany is said to be at
last in distress from lack of food
and materials. The United States {s
transporting troops overseas at a
rate which=stlences criticlam. The
general disposition” {s, therefore, to
regard Germany as acting in desper-
ation, There are warnings of a Ger-
man pence offensive, which would de-
tach Italy or France or both, and {t
ia, suggestdd, though nog convincing
ly, that for-the purposes of. a peace
offensbve Germany would spread
news ef her own distress, The Kaiser,
however, who is the only. German
spokesman from whom. we now hear,
urges on his goldiery by unqualified
assurances of victory,

ed havoc with the thacco plants of
several growers of Virinin leaf on the
Ridge, The hot smi was driven
against the plants birning and cut-
ting them down; Anong the losers
are Wm. Mitchell wh» fs reported to
have lost 15 acres; Sibert Hewer 5
acres, Verner Fox 4 mres, and others
lesser amounts. The acreage affected
will all have to ‘be replanted. The
wind also blew so nuch sand through
the open windows # the Ridge school
that they had“to be closed, which {n-
terfered with the ventilation and the
school closed for the day at 3 o'clock,
The Marsh onion fleds also felt the
effects of the high wind and a heavy

from this cause are the Essex Grow-

The bigger Comfort Soap bar for the
same money is pretty good news in these
daya of high prices isn't it? What does
it mean? Simply that -our tremendous
buying powerin the soap-materals market
can give you infinitely better value in Soap
than it can in premiums,

   
    
   
   
  
  

Owing to the war hundreds of factories are now making more essential goods
than premiums, and the premiums still offered us are too far under Comfort standards
of quality, and are certainly too high in price, to be good value for you.

  

So we will discontinue

: premiums
until after the War, anyhow. ?

All premiam-bearing Comfort Soa
wrappers and coupons now out will
still be redeemed from our present
ample Premiam stock.

No premiums—but every friction ok every
cent you,pay ia returned to you in splendid
Comfort Soap—the best way in war time.

Men Nineteen and Twenty Years of Age. .
~ It has come to the attention of the Government that there is a widespread

impression that young men of nineteen years, and those who became twenty
since October 13, 1917, az well as those who may become nineteen from time to
time and who have been or will be ealled upon to register under the- Military
Seryice Act, are to be immediately called to the colours.

-’ @ This impression is quite incorrect. No date has yct been fixed. for calling
upon such men to so report for duty, nor has the question been brought before
the Cabinet for decision, - In view ofthe need of Jabour on the farm, it is most
unlikely that consideration will be given to the matter until after the harvest is
over, although of course the Government’s action must be determined primarily
by the military situation.

There is no«further obligation incumbent upon young men of the ages
above mentioned who havo registered or. who do 80 hereafter, until they recetve
notice from the Registrars.

Harvest Leave.

_ - *Somé-enquiries have-been received as to the possibility of granting harvest ©

Jeave to such troops as may. bein the country at that time. No definite assur-
ance can be given on this point as advantage must be.taken of ships as they
becotae available. On the other hand, harvest leave will be given if at all

possible.

Leave of Absence on Grounds of Extreme Hardship.

© — Itis desired that the Regulations respecting leave of ibsence in eases of hard-
ship should be widely known and fully understood., Such leave will be granted
in two cases:— (a) where extreme hardship arises by reason of the fact that the
man concerned is either the only son capable of earning. livelihood, of a father.
