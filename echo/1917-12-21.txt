Sweet angel heralds chanting loud

My Lord was-born in Bethlehem,
And in a manger laid.
None tended him, none cherished
him,
Save that sweét mother-maid.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem,
And wise men came to see

His lowly state and homage paid
To his mild. majesty.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem,
But soon he had to flee,

For-cruel late of sinful man
Spared not his infancy.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem,
But home had none on earth;
A pilgrim and a stranger lie,

An exile from his birth.

My Lord was born in Bethlehem.
He died, but rose again.

bought—
New life for sinful men.

Windsor Business College
~ WINDSOR, ONTARIO.

  

YOUNG FRIBNDS:—-Victery Loan Bonds are both Patriotic and Pro-
fitable and the public were anxious to invest in them, but now that
the canvass is completed, we would draw your attention to a course,
at our school, the results of which would be to bring you 100, to 200,
40 600 per cent. on your investment, as thousands of opr former stu-
dents can teatify.

The demands for office help the next six months will be greater
than wo can possibly supply, so YOU should regiater with us in Janu-
ary for a real practical training. Notwithstanding the fact that we
have NO SOLICITORS out, we have the Best and the Strongest Class
of ali years, some 85 in the Shorthand and Typewriting department,
and January should increase our present attendance at least 6¢ ge
cent. Business college and their courses differ widely, but we allow
no other school to surpass us in Teachers, Dawinment and Courses,
Our Senlor Book-koeping Course is conducted with Currency and Mer-
echandise {cards}, also Bank, Freight, Wholesale and Retall offices,
which sree managed by the Séntors, with whom the Juniors do all
kinds of buginesd; this-we call our Busy Bee department, and. you
would enjoy watthing this class.

Here the pupil writes out, and puts through every form of busl-
ness paper, in fact {t is a Miniature Business World,

We have four ladies in the Amherstburg factory office at $15 per
week.

The Cudman College stands for the strongest Commercial Train-
inc and the highest type of Citizenship, and the Moral Influences of
this school far outweigh Dollars. The rooms which were specially
prepared Yor. us are light and cheerful, with glass partitions, which
allow the Principal to look over’the entire set of rooms from his ofce
door. We exp to have several of our business and profeasional men
talk to the classes on DIVE TOPICS.

We never interfere with High Schoo! pupila, as we try to live on
the best.of terms with all the teachers, yet if any student CH. 3S.) in-
tends to change to a Business College course, we say with confidence
that we can do.more for you than any ot! school, because we. give
Individual attention, if necessnr and because this Ja the only Can-
adian Business College within 45 miles with the necesairy equipment.

With some 30 years’ experience in Business College ‘work, 15 of
these in Windsor, should give us a knowledge not possessed by any
Amateur.
