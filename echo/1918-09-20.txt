ODDFELLOWS’ MEMORIAL.

 

It is a comforting thought among
Oddfellows throughout the world that
after they “go west” their brethren
keep thelr memories. and their grayes
green, and at least once a’ year in a
body visit the “city of the dead” and
lovingly place floral tributes upon each
grave and conduct the memorial ser-
vice of,the Order, which. through
intimate association has become fa-
miliar as the ritual to all members.
Sunday last this annual memorial was
held by Rose Lodge, No. 28, 1.0.0.F,,
Amherstburg, and brought out one of
the largest gatherings ever held un-
der ‘similar auspices, nearly two hun-
dred and Ofty brethren marching in
the procésaion, led by the Leamington
Citizens Bapd. Ag the funeral of a
departed brother, Michael Lawler, was
timed for the same hour, it was most
appropriate ¢hat the brethren should
pay a last yieit to the tiome and act
as an escort to the graveside in Rose
Hill cemetery, marching all the way,
showing that they wére im accord
with the request to save gusoline, Af-
ter officiating at the interment of the
laté Bro, Lawler, the formal march
took place to the various mounda
which mark the homes of departed
mémbers of Rose and other lodges,
Loving hands placed floral tributes on
each grave, and the customary ser-
vice for the dead was conducted, at
the Oddfellows’ lot, kept perpetually
green for the last resting place of
Three Link members who far from
home may die in this community, Up-
on returning to Amherstburg an hour
of social intercourse was enjoyed in
the lodge room, while the band gave
& very much appreciated concert on
the street. Large representations
were present from Walkerville, Wind-
sor, Essex, Kingsville, Harrow and
other points in Essex county. Am-
ongst these, uniformed Canton_mem-
bers from Windsor occupied a pfomin-
ent place, Their marching and drill
were very interesting.

DEATH OF M. LAWLER.

 

Michae] James Lawler, a long time
resident of Amhefstburg, passed away
at his home on Sandwich street, on
Thursday evening of last woek, in the
7ith year of his age. He had been
failing for the past three years and
for many months the end was daily
expected, The fungral was held Sun-
day afternoon under the auspices of
Rose Lodge, No: 28, 1. 0.,0. F., “oft
which deceased had bean & member
for years. Rev. H..A, Wright, rector
of Christ church, conducted services
at thé house and by the graveside.
There was a very large attendance,
over one hundred and fifty’ members
of the Oddfellows, ‘whose annual de-
coration day it was, forming an_es-

MAY CHANGE STANDARD ZON

,

Changes in the standard time zones
by the United States, moving the
lines slightly westward, are recom-
mended in a tentative report made
public Thureday by the Interstate
Commerce Commission. The primary
object of the changes which will be-
come effective next Thanksgiving, if
the commission finally approves the
report, is to unify the time-changing
practices of cross-country railroads.
The proposed new boundary between
the eastern and central zones will
run through a point near Port Huron,
Mich., south through Detroit, Toledo,
Columbus, Kenova, W. Va.,  Britsol,
Johnson ity, Tenn.;- Thomasville,
Ga., and Apalachicola Bay, Fla, The
present line extends. from Buffalo
through Pittsburgh, and thence south.
Between the central and mountain
zone the new line would go from
Porta, N, D., south along the Missouri
river to a point near Pierre, 8. D.,
thence southwest to the White River,
thence to the Nebraska-South Dakota
state line through Nebraska along the
Niobrara and Republican rivers to
Kangas, near Philipsburg, detouring
west to Dodge City and back to Mine-

 

 
 
  

generally westward to Collingsworth,
Tex., and thence southward to the
Rio Grande,

IN SOUTHWESTERN OHIO

       
     
    
   
  
   
 
 
 
  
  
    
  
 

 

Corn root rot, a disease which
causes the pink mold found in the
ears of corn at cutting and husking
time seems to be more prevalent now
than at anywrecent corn harvesting
season, according to botanists at the
Ohio Experiment Station. Inquiries
regarding the disease so far have
come in largest numbers from south-
western Ohio.

The disease, for which no easy
method of prevention has yet been
worked out, may infest elther the soil
or the seed corn but seems to cause
more damage in fields growing corn
continuously than where regular crop
rotations are followed, However, on
experimental plots where so{l has not
been grown for several years until
thia season, the root rot has made an
appearance, indicating that the fun-
gus may be transmitted in the seed.

So far the selection of seed corn
from hills in the standing corn not in-
fected with the pink mold {is recom-
mended by investigators a5 a means
of combating the root rot. It {4

nessa. ’

(Contributed by Ontario Department of
Agriculture, Toronto.)

 

HE first point to observe in
the packing of butter, in
order to have it keep well
for winter use is to have
good butter.- The best butter for
packing is usually made in tho
months of June and September. It is
preferably made from comparatively
sweet cream which has been pasteur-
ized. However, on the farm pasteur-
ization is not commonly followed,
hence the butter should be mado
when the weather is comparatively
cool and the cream should be churn-
ed before it becomes very sour—ip
fact, the sweeter the cream the more
likely it is to produce good keeping
quality in the butter, so long as there

is sufficient acid in the cream to give
good churning results.

The cream should be churned in
the usual way, except that the butter
may be washed once with brine,
which is made by dissolving salt In
water, instead of using water at both
washings. Salt at the usual rate—
but not over one ounce of salt per
pound of butter, because salt does
not preserve butter as is commonly
supposed, except in a minor degree
for unpasteurized*cream butter. “It
is a mistake, however, to add so
much salt that the fine favor of the
butter is covered up.

Having worked the butter as us-
ual, pack it firmly into crocks, tubs
or boxes, If unparafined wooden
packages are used, these should be
sonked several days in salt water to
prevent “woody” flavor in the butter,
A better plam is to coat the inside
of the tub or box with hot wax, then
line with heavy parchment paper, be-

 

fore packing the butter, Glazed
crocks which are clean, need no
lining. nl

When the package is full, prefer-
ably all from one churning, smooth
the top of the butter, cover with
.parchment paper or a clean ¢otton
cloth, then Ue heavy brown paper
over the top and place in a cool
cellar or in cold storage. Sometimes
a salt paste is put on top of the cloth
or paper and this;is kept moist by
sprinkling.©on water from time to
time, This excludes the air and helps
to keep the butter,

We recommend packing the butter
in solid form: which is to be kept for
some time, mather than holding the
butter in priints, even though these
may be submerged in brine.—Prof.
H. H. Dean, O). A. College, Guelph.

Select ‘Seed Corn Now.

Unless évermy precaution is taken
this autumn tthe supply of good seed
corn of the ‘diesirable varieties will
be inadequate) for the requirements
,of 1919. The autumn of 1917 saw
the corn crop lharvested with an ex-
ecss of moisture, Wet cold weather
followed, durimg which time the corn
did not cure, consequently, when the
,very cold weather of December set
in the corm was frozen and germina-
tion was meduced to a very low per-
centage, Tinis situation which caused
the agricultural authorities of North
America 50 much anxiety during the
winter and spring of 1918, and
which was; described by them as “a
national ca/lamity,” is not yet averted.
The problem which that committee
had to face was one of supplying
North America with seed which
would give a fair germination. To

secur® this seed, Was no easy task
and recourse was’ made to districts
in the United States hundreds of
miles to the south of Ontario which
produce large, late maturing varie-
ties, In bringing this seed into the
country there was little expectation
that it would produce much grain,
but it was hoped it would produce
foddér, ‘The situation in Ontario was
so acute that ap embargo was placed
on tie seed growm in Kent and Essex
founties prohibiting the exportation
from those counties to other districts
in Ontario; Some seed-of fair germ-
ination was available, but not sufii-
cient for all their local néeds, and
as those counties located in southern
and western Ontario furnish the
chief source of seed for the remain-
der of the province it was felt that
such action was justified tn onder to
conserve those varieties for seed pur-

bores which had proven themselves [

adapted to Ontario conditions.

There was never a time in On-
tario’s history when it was more ne-
ceasary Vo tuke every precaution in
the selec\ioh of seed cérn than at the
Present Uline, The most satisfactory
method Of seed sclectidn is that of
selecting 1 the feld. The grower can
BO up and down his rows and select
thos@ ears which are early, well de-
veloped ay possess all Varietal
characteriatics,° When selecting in
the field the grower has before him
jthe stand|ig plant. He can select
from (hogs plants which possess the
height, ftrength, leafinegs and ecaril-

type 14 established in the grower's
inind good progréas can be made in
selecting the cars. This method of-
Mers many advantages over that of
selecting from the shock or from the
crib, The crib is the Teast desirable,
rin that it offers only husked ears-to
elect from. With the shock, when
busking, the grower has the wilted or
matured stalks, while the fleld selec-
Uow has everything In its favor, the
whole plant and its environment
which may mean normal or abnormal
conditions for velopment. — Dr,

THE CANADA FOOD BOARD SAYS:
1 ‘

Do householders in Canada seek to
evade the food regulations? Are the
merchants of Canada conniving at the
evasion of the food regulations? Let
us see about that.

The main objective of the Canada
Food Board is to supply Great Britain
and the Allies with vital foods. With
this in view food regulations are
made, which, if respected by the peo-
ple of Canada, will enable Canada to
keep falth with her Allies on food.

Do the people of Canada want to
keep faith with the Allies on food?
THEY DO. Are the people of Canada
keeping faith with the Allies om food?
THEY ARE?

To take any other position is to sug-
gest that the people Of Canada would
rather keep their pre-war food” habits
than keep faith with the Allies on
food. No true Canadian {is breaking
the regulations of the Canida# Food
Board for he knows those regulations
are made in order that Great Britain
and the Allies and the Canadian army
at the front may be properly fed.
Who of us will eat what should be
conserved for the Canadian Army at
the front?

The hearta of the people of Canada
are sound and in this war to a finish.
Food is a first-class munition of war
and Canadians so view it. It will be

  

time enough to. go in for ratféns in »

Canada* when the people of Canada
refuse (o conform to national efforts
to conserve food for Great. Britain
and the Allies, and the Canadian Army
at the front. When that time comes,
a Policeman, not a Food Controller,
will be needed.

You'll Be Sure of Having An All-
| Wool. Coat This Winter

We would not mialead you into believing there will be an overcoat
shortage—get this distinction.

There will be woollen overcoats available but prices will be such
that, in many cases, they will be out of the reach of the ordiniry man,

   
      
              
    

Why not make sure of having a warm, firat quality woollen overcoat
this winter by purchasing one now, a little in adyance of the regular

season.
Compare the quality of our fabrics—styles are much alike because

of Government restrictions—also compare our prices for the same qual-
ity merchandise.

Then -you will understand why we say “Buy Your Overcoat Now.”
