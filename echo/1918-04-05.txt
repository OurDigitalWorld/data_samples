Oats contain more body-bullding food than
any other grain that grows. They contain
more cnergy-giving food. You know their
effect on horses.

Oats contain more organic Phosphorus
than any other.grain, and Phosphorus isthe
brain's main constituent. ‘They contain
more’ lecithin, and lecithin is the chief
component of the entire nervous system.

But some oatmeal fails to ‘meet these
requirements, Only the-richest, plumpest

RIOTS IN QUEBEC CITY.

Caused by Opposition to Draft Act—
Two Newspaper Offices Wrecked
—Three Persons Shot—City Un-
der Militia Act.

On Friday a mob opposed to the op-
| Position of the Militia Act terrorized
the business section of the city of Que
bec. The mob destroyed the newspa-
ber offices-of the Chronicle and L'Even-
i and wrecked the premises of the
local registrar undér the Military Ser-
viee Act.

The building in which the offices are
located is adjacent to the Anuditoriam
Theatre, and the theatre caught fire.

The intention ofthe crowd, it is be-
leved, was to destroy all the records
jor cases which have been heard in the

exemption courts.
Mayor Lavigneur read the riot act
amidst jeers and called out the militia.

The appearance of the military had |

& pacifying effect on the throng.
The troops formed a cordon around
the Auditorium Theatre, while the fire-
men worked to get the firé under con-

Rioting continued on Saturday night, |°

when the element which'appears fo be
organizing the disturbances "made an
attempt Yo break {nto the driil hall at
Grande Allee: ~The intention of the
rioters was, it is rumored, to Itherate
draftees on duty there. The attémpt
failed, as the building was protected
by a cordon of soldiers, who easily re-
sisted the attacks, anid. with the help
of mounted troops, broke up the mob's
organization. No shooting took place.

The intentions of the mob leaders
are indicated by ‘a raid made upon
the © hardware’ store of Brousseau
Freres in the éarly hours of Sunday
morning. This.firm's store {s on St.

Points that have been-attacked so far.
It was not being patrolled by the mil-
Mary. The store was broken into and
revolvers nd gimmunition
moved.

Furtier disturbances of a graver
nature occurred on Sunday night dur-
ing which threé persons were shot and
slightly wounded. A number of regi.
ments from different parts of Canada
were sent. to Quebec to supplerient
the local forces.

The milive-> decided to remove all
firearms from all hardware stores fo)-
lowing the raid on an establishment
handling guns and ammunition during
the early hours’ of Sunday morning.
The firearms were taken to theeitadel: |

The action of the military was re-
sented bythe mob faction and soldiers
engaged In this task were pelted with
missles. In oné case the rioters set a
hardware store belonging to Martineau
Brothers on fire, The mob was ali]
to reach the store containing Weapons
before the soldfers, and they broke it
open. | The premises raided belonged
to Samson & Filjon

Sunday an appeal by Cardinal Begin
or a cessation of the disturbances was
read in afl the Cathdlic churthes and
Sunday night the Nationalist leader,
Armand Lavergne, addressed 2 mob
raiding a hardware store and coun-
selled the men to stop the disorders.

Monday ‘night rioting again broke
out and a number of men suspected
of leadership in “the disorders were
arrested. Later soldiers fired a volley
in the disorderly elements, From the
fact that many new faces have appear-
od the last fow days, it is suspected
‘that the trouble has been caused by
the L W. W. and German money.

HOW TO GROW POTATOES.

When three hundred and thy-two
years ago Sir Walter Raleigh intro-
duced the potato: from*this ‘continent
into Ireland, nobody could have fore.
seen or imagined the immense part
that it would come to play in feeding
the world. It was nearly eighty years
before the Royal Society of England
took up the cultivation of the potato
as a cheap food in case of famine, In
another eighty years famine in Scot-
land brought the potato into extensive
notice as a’ cheap article of food. “An-
other thirty years saw France taking
notice of its vadue. Wz» T. Macoun,
the Dominion Horticulturist, briefly
explains all this ina hundred-page
bulletin recently issued by the Depart-
Ment of Agriculture,.Ottawn, in which
{8 also given complete and~ compre-
hensive information as to the cultiva-
tion of the potato. . Mr.:.Macoun goes

that shouldbe taken during’ growth;
and of garnering, storing and shipping.
