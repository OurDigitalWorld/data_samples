—The Provincia} Bosrd of Health
has issued a circular on how to avoid
and how to care for influenza, which
is all summed up in the two clauses:
“The great danger is from pneumonia.
Avoid it by staying in bed while actu-
ally i and until convalescence is
fully established. The after effects of
influenza are worse than the disease.
Take care of yourself.”

 

Lord Shaughnessy has resigned cs
president of the Canadian Pacific Rail-
way. and is succeeded in this office
by E. W. Beattty. KC. vice-president.
Lord Shaughnessy will retain the
post of chairman of the board of direc-
tors. Sir George Bury rotires from his

viding any control of it is concerned,

cessaries, and to fix prices. The in-
vestigation, it fs stated, will * cover
boots’ and shoes, textiles. staple goods,
@te. The United States has already

prices of a jarge number of such com-
modities.

Why Canada must borrow:
money to Carry on _.

borrow hundreds of millions’ of
dollars— =~ ;

And, this money must be borrowed
from the people of Canada:— .-

Therefore, Canada will presently oe
come to her people for a new Victory :
Loan to carry on.

Because Canada has put her hand
to the plow and will not turn back:—

—our country is in the war on the
side of liberty and justice and will stay
in it till complete victory is won’and
the unspeakable Hun is smashed and

beaten to the ground;

_—a nation at war must make tre- + 4 >}
mendous expenditures in cash to keep
up her armies-and. supply them with

munitions, food and.clothing; _

—Canada must finance many mil-
lions of dollars of export trade in food,
munitions and supplies which Britain
and our allies must have on credit;

Canadians will Joan. the money by
again buying’ Victory Bonds. ~ ~~

The national safety, the national
honor and the national well-being
require that each and every Canadian -
shall do ‘his duty by lending to the z
nation every cent he can spare for this
purpose.

_—

 

 

—for these purposes Canada must

living in this neighborhood to pay
great attention to the upkeep of this
road for nea fifty syeara. Away
back in the Iate’70's, before the town-
ship was divided, the great portion
of the road wns thickly gravelled by
the commutation of statute labor for
5 years, This policy was inaugurated
by the early reevea—Edward Dunstan,
A. H. Anderson, M. Barrett and Wm.
Campbell. Mn Barrett is the only
one of the quartet living. The mey

when it came to doing & big day’s
work. They went off at 7 o’clock in the

contests were held to see not only
who could draw thé largest, but the
one who could draw the most loads
in one day, And the 600d road which
