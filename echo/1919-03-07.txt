“Mis Moore, you have a wonderful
voice. You can easily win a career
with it.” J. Edward Rolifson, in:
strucor in vocal music, in a wide-
awaly western town, spoke with a
warmh he rarely showed.

Esthon, Moore listened with a flush
on her cheek ond a brilliant gleam in
her eys, And as she listened, she
smiled ‘mn anticipation of the honors
she woull win.

That wening Esther and Roland
Lewis went to the theater together.
For some ceason or other, there
seeméd-to bs a slight difference be-
tween this and previous~ evenings,
Esther was cather restrained in her
conversation. Roland was plainly
puzzled. He strove to-dispel the cold-
ness, But he was not successful.

A light supper was no more suc-
cessful. When they reached her home
they sat doww in the llving room. For
a while the conversation mgged. At
Ingt, Roland could stand it no longer.

He spoke up impatiently.

“Esther, what on earth is the mat-
ter tonight? You act as if you had
swallowed an iceberg.”

She hesitated.a moment, then eétam-
mered oup: “IT think we had—well,
had better break our engagement.”

Roland did. not move a muscle.
However, his face became as white
as marble; his jaws snapped firmly
shut; his lips were a thin, colorless
line.

_ “Have you such a thing as a reason

or did you forget to provide one for
the occasion?’ He spoke _ slowly,
coldly.

Seeing the result of her announce-
ment on Roland, the girl was a little
consclence stricken.

“Really, Roland, I did not think
you would tnk@ut that way. But Mr.
Rulifson said I-could win a career
with my voice. And would you have
me give it up and get married?”

“Not at all. Of course, a career {is

} Q great deal better than mere love. I
wish you success in it. Good-bye!”

He got up and went out. Esther
expected, yes, she, hoped, he would
kiss her good-bye, but he did not

— | do 60.

As time passed, Esther grew more
and more*proficient {n her work. Her
teacher became very enthusiastic
about her. He introduced her’ into
society, and she gaye many private
recitals. She was jn continual de
mand for dinner parties. It was the
fad of society to hear her singing. Mu-
aicians of note listened to her and
praised her voice,

Thus, it was no grent wonder that
the girl’s head became slightly turnet?
She forgot her old friends, forgot Ro-
land, forgot everything except that
she. had a wonderful and successful
career before her.

One day Esther’s happiness reached
its climax.’ She was invited to lunch-
eon at the home of the most popular
social leader of the ‘town. Mrs. De
Lamater, was not only popular but
wealthy, A mam of forelgn appearance

seemed pleased at Wéther's knowl-

Finally, “the hostess called Esther

to her side.

“3fiss Moore,” ehe said, “how svould
you like to study a few years in New
York with Professor Rinardo?”

“Why, ~Mrs. De Lamater,. I—of

fusion. She “did)not know what to

- The woman smiled and continued:

“T would love to.” Esther sank on
her knees beside .her benefactress._
“Flow enn I ever thank you?”

“By winhing honors in a successful
career. Be ready.to start Saturday
night. I will Bee about your ward-

Esther left with her bead in a whirl.
She could hardly see to walk straight.

Thursday Esther went to the home

her remaining time. Evelyn's father,

With many factories planning to re-
|sume activities at anormal rate in the
nenr future, a4large number’ of for-
eigners are going to find” themselves
out of, big-paying jobs, according to
statements made to Capt. Asa Minard,
G. W V. A. Secretary. When Canad-
jans went to war their plage in many.
instances were taken by aliens, and
when wages went up to @ war basis
much of the increase went into the
pockets of men who refused to fight
fér Canada. Factory heads aré assur-
ing Capt. Minard that withthe time at
hand for opening up, returned men will
be given the opportunity to fill every
position formerly held by foreigners,
The headquarters of the Soldiers’ Hm-
ployment Bureau, in charge of Lieut.
Strickland, has already been opened
in Windsor. “Wittle difficulty in plac-
ing returned men and civilian Canad-

—A compartive table of milk prices
in the Province compiled by the Do-

being’ the highest priced City.or town
in. the’ country as far as the Iacteak
fiuid is concerned. While cities like
Toronto, Hamilton and London are
getting nrilk*for from 12 to 14 cents a
quart, citizens of Windsor are obliged
to pay 17. cents for the best quality
} milk, “London, a little more than a
hundred miles away, gets its milk for
12 cents. Just what justification there
is-for a difference of five cents in price
between London and Windsor does~
not appear, and the local Fair Price
Committee is saying nothing, and so
far ns known has done nothing to al-

HOW’S THIS?

There is more Catarrh in this sec-
tion ofthe country than all! other: dis-
eases put together, and until the last
few years was supposed to be incur-
able,.For a great many yedrs doctors
pronounced it a local disease and
prescribed local remedies, and by con-
stantly failing to cure with local treat-
ment, pronounced it incurable, Science
has proven Catarrh to be a consti-
tutional disease, and therefore re-
quires cOnstitutional treatment. Hall's
Catarrh Cure, manufactured by F. J.
Cheney & Co., Toledo, Ohio, is the
[only Constitutional cure on the mar-

where access is cut off. In the past

arose from a suit heard in the Essex

Rheumatism

_, Bhoumatiam hap become so common
nowadays that hundreds of people
make no effort to rid thomscives of ite
fatal grip, believing it to be incurable
gavo in exceptional cases.

No groater fallacy exists. Sufferers
from rheumatism can be relieved if the
cause ip remedied and removed.

Let us examine the facts, The direct
cause of rheumatism and kindred dis-
enaes is poisoning of the blood stream,
through failuro of the kidndys to filter
and romove the impurities that are con:
atantly collecting in the systeu.

Once the kidneys are out of order,
tho trouble starts. The poison-ladened
Dlood circulating through the system
deposits its impurities in the muscles
and joints, setting up infection, and
Rheumatism, Lumbago, Sciatica, etc,
follow.

Tho first step necessary is to bring
the kidneys to perform their natural
function once again, and rolief will be
tho immediate result. Gin Pills will do
it, and will save weeks of earful sut-
fering if taken at the first indications
of rheumatism.

Gin Pills have been recognized as an
assured relief to sufferers from rheuma-
tiam, backache, painful urination, brick |
dust deposits, and gravel. Thousands |

 

of testimonials bear witness to the fact |,

that they relieve kidney or bladder }
troubles instantly. Try them. For adle
everywhere at 50c a box. Gin Pills
cost little, but are worth a lot, Sample

LEAVES ALL TO LADY LAURIER.

~Sir Wilfrid's Will to Dispose of Estate
. of About $160,000.

The late Sir Wilfrid Laurier’s will
{s to be entered for probate withth a
week. It is understood thafhe left an
estate valued at about $160,000, and
that.practically the sole beneficiary is
Lady Laurier.

The estate includes the revenue from
a Government annuity of $100,000 pur-
chased for him by friends some years
ago, residential property in Ottawa
and ‘Arthabaska Life Insurance» and
some stocks In Canada Cement, Mont-
“real Power, Montreal Tramways and
certain other companies. i

LADY LAURIER HAS
Py DECLINED OFFER OF ;
GOVERNMENT PENSION

Has Been Left in Comfortable, If Not
Opulent Circumstances,

It ja understood that the Government
has tendered to Lady Laurier the offer
ofp pension. and that she has declined
it. It would appear that Sir Wilfrid's
estate was of cénsiderablé. value, due
largely to the fact that some twenty

. years ago a number of Liberal friends
arranged for him an annuity of some
$5,000. Sir Wilfrid died in harness.
and had been drawing his sessional
allowance, and his allowance ag lead-
er, which have been sufficient to meet
the demands of his simple life. The

» annuity has therefore been practically

untouched, and has been accumulating
ugh careful investments. In ad-
dition his property on Laurier avenue,
which Griginally cost in the neighbor-
of $7,000, Is now’ valved at prob-
ably $40,000.”

BELIEVE ALL THE STORIES.

L'eut. Beverley Robinson, R. A, F.,
who, after two dnd a half years of
captivity, succeeded in Making an es-
cape himself and had other exper!-
ences of an unsual nature, speaking
in .fassey Hall, Toronto, the other
evening, said: “Since returning to
this country, Ijhave found a dispost-
tion on the part’ of some to make light
of the stories of cruelty which have
been told of the Germnons and their
treatment of@tle Canedian soldiér.
[o not make tight of them, for they
are all true. Thore are worse stories
thun any you have heard yet. If you
are inclined to make light of |mprison-
meni, then try to think what jt means )
to live for months or years in the
insanitary, pesatilentia) camps in Ger-
many, where every possible effort
wag made to heap jnowlt and inde
sertbable cruelty upon the rion.) Think
what {t means to work twelve or four-
teen hours o day in the salt mines, to
be tied up to postsjin zero wetaher, ta \-
be hung up by the wrists, or even tay
wash your clothing in ice-cold water.
And remember, as well, that the Cnn: |
adian prisoners came through that
with ‘their spirits unbroken and you }
may have some idea what it is to be
a Canadian soldier. Remember also, |
that the Canadians pave the Germans
more trouble, and did less work, thaw
any other class of iprisoner, and do}
not muke light of the  prii:onment in|
Germany.
worse things then any that have yet)
been told.” Like Lt. tan Cameron, |
who recently returned to St. Thomas, |
Lieut. Robinson says the Postminden |

believes the eommander of that camp,}
Charles Noemeyer, will be one of the |”
first of the German officers to be de-
manded by the Allies for punishment

A GOO\” COMBINATION.

Live Stock iaising and Beets for

Sugar.

Sugar beet raising, combined with
the keeping & jive stock, is claimed
to provide a Oiir-rate means of build-
ing up a farming district; the feeding
value of the bee! pulp and tops pro-
viding In large Minaure for the late |.
fall and early winter feeding of the
farm cattle, and at he same time,
for the restoring sf fertility to the’
soll, while the roasts themselves pro-
vide & most s@istactary cash crop
wherever Jater is procurable at 4
reasonable pyice, The thorough and
deep cultivation necessary for the
successful production of sugar beets,
which. coulda not be afforded in the
cage of crogs of less money vadue, as-
sures a Splendid condition of the so!l
for other crops in the mixed or stock
farm rotation, white the extra labor
needed in beet cultivation on a small
scale, can be employed at other sea-
sons, to a considerable extent, where
cattle are fed for miJk or beef, or
other livé stock raised for the may-
ket, as.largely as possible

During the past year fnugar bet
growing has extended considerably
on account of the keen demand for
sugar to take the place of the nor-
mal import supply, held’ up by the
existing ocean shipping conditions.
Most of the undertakings in the
growing line have, however, been on

Belleve all for there are a large scale and the live stock ralis-

ing possibilities in connection with
the industry do not seem to have
been greatly considered. With the
increase in the labor supply, such As
can be expected as a result of peace
conditions, a general return to more
intensive farm practice may be fook-

| ed for; and with the resulting gen-

eral improvement in the condition of
farms in many districts, as regards
their fertility, the advisability of in-,
cluding sugar beets in the rotation
of the stock farm should be given
consideration.

Southern Alberta {s tmdieated as a
successful sugar beet raising section,
the area suited to sch production
being larger than any two of tife
largest producing sections in the
United States, and the product jis of
high quality. 4

Tests made with beets grown wn-
der irrigation, from (five different
kinds of seed at the Dominion Govy-
ernment Experimental Furm at Leth-

15% and 9% tons per acre, with a
sugar content of15.84, 19.42, 17.85

The only drawback to the fmme-
diate extension of th Industry In
Alberta i§ the lack of labor. Comndi-.
tions of soll and climate in that pro-
vince are said to’ be ideal, but al-
most, if not exactly similar conditions
could be found in othr provinces of
the Dominion, while, iim Ontario par-
ticularly; the labor problem could be
more easily solved« . Besides; stock
raising as a farm undertaking, {s an
industry sufficiently developed in On-
{ario to present. a very good oppor-
tunity for combining dhe growing of
sugar beets with, the raising of cattle.

What Enrope's ‘Shortage Is,

The intest report am the shortage
of live stock in Eurome was presented
by Mr, H. B, Thomson, chairman of
the Canada Food Board, at the Live
Stock. Conference Ineld recently at
Ottawa, Mr. Thomson gave the con-
vention figures jusit. received from
the Food Administration in London
ns to the latest officiinl estimates of
the liye stock dé@ficiiency. in thoge
tountries of Europe iin which it has
been possiblé to prepare reports.
Including Great Britain, France,
itaty, Denmark, Swetlen, Holland and
Germany the total deficit is: Cattle,
6,506,000; -sheep, 5,420,600,. and
pigs, 26,810,200.

For Austria-Hungary no

astimated as extremely serious.

In Britain there is a shortage of
25 per cent. in hogs, and in England
and Wales sheep one year of age
and over have decreased by 11:3 per
cents in the present’yemr, andin Scot-

Poultry In Storage.

The poultry marketis are still un-
partisfactory, Receipts while. not
larger than other years on record,
are more than the packers can com-
fortably take care of, ®xperienced
dressera are difficult to get, and stor-
age spice is scaree, The result its
prices quoted recently are materially
lower than those offered for some
time, Stocks of powltry in storage
fiow are larger than at the same date
a year ago.

Raw Material.

Prof. MeVey,-in his “Economies
ef Business,’” says: “In order that
there may be production, it is neces-
sary that raw miaterials be gathered
from the earth andi in dgriculture
that an area of ground be fertfifzed,
and that tools, omganization and o
environment” be secured.
These are the nemwessities of produc-
tion. But the hwman factories are
still to be efficienitly applied”

CRUDE OIL REPORT.

—

The annual report of the Supervisor
of crude petroJeum bounties, of the
Department of Trade and Commerce,
has just been issued and {6 of special
Interest to all who are connected in
the ofl trade of Wes*ern Ontario, The
past year has been one of the most
satisfactory for some seasons, the re-
port shows a large increase in produc-
tlon over the previous year, In the
year 1917 the total production was
203,000 barrels. In the year 1918, the
total production amounted to 288,760
barrels, or an increase of 85,000 bar-
rels. The Tilbury district has shown
up well, having an jnereased produc-
tion of 15,000 barrels. The total pro-
duction there was 882,971 gallons or
25,277 26-35 barrels, One of the sur-
prising features of the report is that
the Belle River district in Essex coun-
tl produced 16,645 gallons, or 447 bar-
rels of oll. After a while when the
Amherstburg district is * thoroughly
tested out, we believe that ofl jn pay-
ing quantifies will be discovered here.
The few test wells which were sunk,
but never successfully. completed.
showed Indications of oil, and experts
have always doped out this ‘district as
being in the ojl belt.

ners received, ag prizes, their cheice
of the various short couses, having
thelr railway fare paid a8 well as beard

to the war many contestants in: the
varfous counties were obliged to drop

ing, 15 cents per hour for man labor
and 10 cents per hour for horse labor.

4 winners Russell Clark, of Lambton
county stood highest with aiyield of
79 bushels per acre; value $63.20; cost
of production, $14.61, and-a net profit
of $48.59. Sugar beets were tested.in

Blood-poisoning and death resulted.
When you or your children sus-

of feed stations for birds. He says:—

“For the past five or six years we
have maintained a number of feed-
ing stations.in various parts of our
park system, with very satisfactory
results. I give a list of the birds
which stay with us over winter. The
permanent winter birds found in‘the

Fallen Leaves.

The value of leaves as: fertilizer is
referred to in the report of the fire
miurshal for Ontario in an appeal to
feltizens to refrain from burning
leaves because of the risk of damage
to buildings entailed in the practice.
“Nature.is a good provider, and one
of nature's most liberal provisions is
the fertilizing of the soil with ‘au-
tumn leaves,” says the writer of the
item on this matter.

The burning of leaves in. town-or
city lots is notyonly a pnenacH to the
buildinga and a nulsance to citizens
in genéral, but is a distinct Toss to
the owner of the lot @n which the
leaves ‘are collected. Prequently city
residents are to be seen raking up
the leaves on their finwns or flower
beds with a yiew (0 burning the

they apply a coating of manure to

, Too Late!

The privilége of shipping apples to
England came too late to be of gen-
eral advantage, efther to growers or
dealers in Ontario.

“Most of the apples in southern

gone info consumptive channels,”
sifd Mr. P, W, Hodgetts; director of
the ‘Provincial Fruit Division, “There

At the opening of the Legislature
last. week, speaking on the address,
| Mr. Proudfoot, the Opposition leader,
criticized the Government for its: fall-
ure to foreshadow certain important
matters in the Speech from. the
Throne. Some of the matters suggest-
ed were as follows: The placing of
soldiers in community centres; that
the’ Government should sppoint a Min-
ister of Labor and not dally with the
question by appointing a Superinten-
dent and then.a Deputy Minister, when]
later on they would be obliged to
create a full Department. Mr. Proud-
foot also constructively criticized the
question Of education. He urged the
introduction of a Faculty of Commerce
into the University, commended the
Government for adopting the Liberat)
policy of giving women seats in the
Hotwe, and urged careful considera: ;
tion of the request for the fon’
of the T. & N. O. to James Bay. The
Liberal leader also expressed sur-
prise at the omission in the Speech

exploded. Such weather conditions

GOOD PASTURE,

MAKES

 

Fish Scraps. Are Excellent Where
They Can Be Procured, and
Alfalfa Hny, Soy Beans, Cowpens
and Onts Are Also Recommended
as Feeds That Will Aid Develop-
ment, ‘ !

Hog growers should provide home-
grown feed to supply protein — so
essentinl to the proper development
of hogs—and feed them in place of
shorts, middlings, tankage and oil
meal, which are hard to gét and high
in price. Stbstitutes for these con-
ewutraie feeds are found in crops
that are known to be rich In protein,
and we are advising the use of fish
meal, where (A is obtainable. Alfalfa
hay, soy beans, cowpeas and oats are
suggested as good substitute feeds.

Fish scrap, waich has heretofore
been used as a fertilizer, has been
tried in hog*feeding experithents con-
ducted by the Department of Agri-
culture, and it has been found that
meal made from this material fs on
a par with tankage when fed to hogs.
A number of state experiment sia-
tions are now conducting simian ex-
periments in feeding fish nied) to
hogs. Owing to the transportation
saltuationghowever, it is believed that
fish meal cannot be fed economically
in many parts of Canada.

Shortage of protein feeds can be
met With alfalfa hay in all localities
where it can be grown or obtained at
reasonable prices. There are two
ways in which this hoy_can be suc-
cessfully fed—in_small racks placed
in protected sheds where the hogs
may have free/acress to it, and by
grinding it and feeding. it in self-
feeders or soaked in the form of
thick slop. The Department’s special-
ists urge that hog growers provide
an ample supply of alfalfa. Usually
the last cutting of alfalfa js saved for
hog feeding, but for fear this cut
ting cannot be harvested in good
condition, a sufficient amount of the
second and subsequent cuttings

I.should be saved to supply enough

feed for hogs.

Rye sown in the fall makes good
pasture for hogs, As soon as it- is
three or four inches high the hogs
can be turned in and left until snow
covers it up. Rye also provides good
pasture in éarly spring.

Soy beans are valuabté to take the
place of other protein feeds usually
purchased. ‘They make n very satis-
factory feed when the beans are fed
threshed, or as hay, or when ground
as meal. Soy-bean hay, to be most
satisfactory, should be~cut early
enough to avoid the popping out of
the seeds. The leaves and the seed
both will be readily eaten when
handled in this manner,

Dwarf Essex rape and oats can-al-
so be uséd successfully in the south
as a forage crop. Ejther can be seed-
ed from the lagt of August to the last
of September. Cottonseed meal can
be very successfully used {n connec-
tion with corn a8 @ hardening feed
for a period not to exceed thirty
days.

Farming In Australia.

Trade Commissioner D. H. Ross,
at Melbourne, in ay account of Aus-
tralin’s “requiremé@pts in the line of
agricultural machinery, points out
that a demand has arisen in that
country for lle spreaders to over-
come the sourtess- of the soil caused
by the continued use of phosphates as
a fertilizer. The machines are chief-
ly in demandsinathe @istricts where
alfalfa is.under cultivation, Further
in his report, which is pablished in
the Trade and Commercé Bulletin,
the commissiener snys: “Despite the
fact that many bushels of wheat are
still held at Ausi«u\lian ports through
lack .of tonnage for ‘ransportation
overseas and that much of the labor
hitherto available to farmefg ig now
on fictive service with the Aystralian
Imperial Fortes abroad, the outlook
for the agricultural implement trade
for 1918-19 is held, by importers, to
be distinctly encouraging.”

The above, together with ths jn-
formation that the Australian Goy-
ernment has made a beginning inthe
repatriation of its soldiers by ad-
vancing to them money for the Pur.
chase of horses, farming implements,
etc., goes’ to indicate that Austratia
will be good and ready, for a big agri-
culturalesadvance now thgt the war
Ys over. Also the statement with
regard to wheat holdings in that
country that the nvailable wogld sup-

ply of that cereal will be such, that

formers in Australin and other parts
of, the empire had -been begin=to ;
think seriously of other lines of en-}
deavor besides wheat growing—pref- |

Bacterized Pept a Fizzle. |

A couple of years ago, it will be
recalléd, sensational announcemen(s
were made as to the results obtained
by, an English: exferimenter in the
use of bacterized peat as a fertilizer.
It was suggested that agriculture was
about to be revolutionized, The
matter was immediately taken up in
the Bacteriological Department and a
test made in1916 in the growing of
radishes.. The test was far from
sntisfactory, but was regarded.as in-
conclusive.’ It was followed in 1917
by tests in the growing of lettuce.
Tt was found that growth; is influ-
enced Slightly possibly in the hasten-
ing of the'ripening process, but the
final conclusion is reathed that the
returns are not gommensurate with
the cost of treatment. Jt. may be
added that similar adverse results
haye been obtained from experiments
conducted on the subject of Rotham~-

The Dates to Plant for Heaviest
Yields,

To Make Most Money From Wool
Shearing Must Be Done Properly
and Wool Handled Carefully—
A Few Hints Which Have Suved
-Farmers Dollars.

(Contributed by Ontario Department of

Agriculture, Toronto.)

HERD is a best time to sow
each class of farm crops to
securo the highest returns.
It is. difficult, however, to

know which are the most favorablo

dates for,the best returns of the dif-
ferent crops,in all seasons. The re-
sults of experiments conducted over

a series of years form a good gen-

eral guide, Some crops Bye best re-

sults from later seedings. Seasons
vary so much that in some years the
grains are practically all sown by the
dates at which it is only possible to
start sowing in other years. It is of
the utmost importance, however, to
start cultivating the land as early as
{t is dry enough to work to good ad-
vantage, The first cultivations should
take place for those, crops which
should be first sown. In this connec-
tion it is interesting to study the re-
sults of an experiment which was

conducted in each of five years at
the Ontario Agricultural College.
Spring wheat, barley, oats and peas
were sown on each of six dates, Ono
week was allowed between each two
dates, The experiment was conduct-
ed in duplicate by sowing with the
grain drill and broadcast by hand in
each instance: The following table
gives the average results for the ten
tests in the five-year period:

Bushels of Grain Per Acre,

Bth acess Saw 27.8 Ab 2116
6th ..cce0 6.7 18.4 “37.0 19.6

It will be seen’ that the spring
wheat gives decidedly the best re-
turns from the first date of seeding.
There is not much difference between
the first two seedings of barley and
oats, but there is a alight advantage
from the first date in*the case of bar-
ley and from the second date in the
case of oats. The peas, however,
gave the highest returns from the
second and third dates, and even the
fourth gave a higher average yleld
than the first date. After the first

week was past there was an_average.| |

decrease per acre for each day’s de-
lay. as the season advanced of 27
pounds of spring wheat, 47,pounds of
barley, 48 pounds of oats, and 20
pounds of peas.

These -esults are of special inter- i

est and are worthy of careful atten-
tion-at this particular time.

 

Sheep Shearing.

Shearing and Tying the Fleece.—
Shearing should only be carried on
under the’most favorable conditions;
upon ‘bright, warm sunshiny days
when the'sheep are dry of fleece and
the wool has “risen” somewhat from
we body. Cleanliness’ and care in
e removal of all fleeces is very es-

-pential and the Shearing floor should

be swept after cach fleete has been
removed and tied® This will elim=
inate a great deal of forejgn matter
which, although it may ad weight,
does so at the expense of quality.
Dung*Locks or Tags.—lIt will be
noticed with many ficeces, that there
are certain hard dung locks or tags
adhering to the britch ends,. These
contain a great deal of moisture and
if left on and rolled into the fleece
produce a damp heavy condition that
means a higher shrinkage and hence

jess value’ ‘They should, whenever

present, be snipped off with “the
shears before thé,sheep is shorn or
else pulledoff by, hand after the fleece
is spread out for rolling: They can
very easily bo packed and shipped
separately, bringing more money this
way than if left upon the fleece, The
game is true of all paint clotted locks
as)well, é ited

Rolling the Fleece.—Spread the
fleece out on the floor, being careful
not to’pull it apart.and with the flesh

and both sides jn until your fleece re.
presents a strip about 18 inches wide,
Starting at the tail end, roll tightly
toward the neck, thus leaving the
shoulder wool, which {is always; the
superior portion, on the outside of
the roll. The grader always estimates
the grade--by, the appearance and
quality of this wool over tlic shoulder
end heart-girth, that over the hind+
