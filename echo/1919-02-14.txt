_——

Unbounded joy and Intense sadness
entered the home of Mrs. Earl Sparks,j
of Sandwich, Ffiday «within a half
hour. Shortly after Mrs. Sparks had
prepared breakfnst, she received a let-
ter from her husband in Belgium. gtat-
‘ing that he was’ well and-on his way
home. .Almost before her tears of joy
had dried, an official telegram was
pushed dnto her hand, bearing thé |
dread .news thathe had died of in-
fluenza in a Belgium hospital. Private }
Sparks, who was the youngest son of |
Mr. and Mrs,- William J. Sparks, of |
Sandwich, ‘went oyerseas in January,
1916, with the Ninety-ninth Battalion.
After serving with the mounted police
in England, he was sent to the trench:
es, going through, the British offensive
that“helped to break the German lines
in Pieardy.

Ernest Graliam, a farmer of Tw eed,
was burned to death in a fire which
destroyed his barn.” It is thought that
a lantern exploded.

other way, But the fact was that Mr.
Francis Pell, whose , ancestors “had
founded the old town, was quite as
much of a character in his way as was
elther the toothless Silas Snell or the
little-spinster who had “always kept
the cent shop.” Although scarce forty,
and although no one had ever seen
him counting out bags of money, nor
had he eyer been known to be crafty
or shrewd in money matters, he was
regarded as “the old miser.” ‘There
were fabulous accounts of the extent
of the Pell fortune, which had once
glittered largé in the mind’s eye of
Pellton mammas, but had long since
ceased to be regarded as in any way
available. - Ms

So: Lucy paid her first coll on Mr.
Pe]l._ pnd was very politely shown to
the*door afte® she had made herself.
quite clear, find she went away feel-
Ing“ a8*much @onfused and disheart-
ened as she had some seven years be-
fore, .when’ she went out on her first
assignment for the big city paper. For
Lucy was-not o native Pelltonite. If
she ‘had been she would have known
better than to try to make news-out
of anything that Francis’ Pell might be
doing. But she knew he, was one of
the most gossiped about personalities
in town. Failing to find* anything
more fertile for discussion about him,
the women discussed the size of* his
|'etocer bills—though they were - per-

fectly normal—or kept close track of
l'his harmless old mammy housekeeper
jor the new cont of paint on his house
or the conditionof his apple orchard.
/But theso-things wouldn't make news
Items for the Sentinel.

Lucy was rebuffed the first time, po-
litely but effectively, and went away
perhaps more upset over a certain
gricious courtesy that Mr. Pell had
shown toward her than because of the
actual rebuff. °

‘But Lucy lind not been a reporter
for seven.years for nothing, and once

ér cheeks had stopped tingling from
that first call she decided to make an-
other, She would. get some sort of
‘Story out of him—that she determined.
;1t was on her third*call that Mr. Pell.
showed signs of weakening.

“You say you want me’ to do some-.
* | thing to make a story about,” he began
"enutlously, looking —amusedly | into
Lucy's eager face and studying “the
nervous twitching of her still girlish
lips. “What sort of thing would you
}suggest—not, of conrse, that I intend
ip do. it

Lucy chose to take him entirely sey.
ously. “Make gome gift to the tows,”
she announced. “Every one thinks you
have loads of money, but—"

“L know,” smiled Mr. Pell, “they call:
me the old miser. It has always amused
me, But I choose to Igy my bene-
factions to myself. I will tell you con-

The eve.of the day when the an-
nouncement+of the plnns was to be
made came at last, and Lucy had the
first big story refdy to send to the lit-
tle Sentinel press. There was ey n to
be a cut showing the design fo the
fountain. And {t bad all ‘been kept a
Secret between Mr» Pell -and Lucy,

The Sentinel was just golng to press
and Lucey was putting the last’ flour-
{shes on the great: announcement in
the dingy little oflde long after. other
food Pelltonites had retired for the
aight. The ownerteditor, ‘aun errand
boy, the other reporter andia handfal
of compositors and pressmen consfi-
tuted the’entire staff, and they were
too preoccupied with their tasks to no-
“ce the figure of Francis Pell os it
passed quickly’ across thé floor to
Lucy’s desk. He sat down beside her,
laid. a nervous hand on: the copy she
was still working on. “There'sm hitch
{n our plang,’ oJ can't-tell you now. But
trust me. . You mustn't make the. an-
founcement nows” ‘Then he went, tell-
{ng Lucey he would wait for her out-
side the little office and (ell-her more
as he escorted her home as soon as she
had finished her work,

“It's this why,” he began. “Men
from the water department*have been
feeling around lately? and today I got
4 notice from hendquarters, That
spring isn’t n spring at all, It’s n leak
from the main. That water is just the
same water every one hos piped into
thelr houses, and now. they send me
formal word that In future I'll hive to
have it metered and pay for It at regu-
lar rates, I don’t mind paying the few
hundred dollars it would ‘cost a year,
but no one would enre about the foun-*
tain if it was plain elty water, and
they’re likely to hive the joke on the
old miser,. So we'll have to think of
Something else to. do,” ° They walked
along in silence for a few minutes,
Lucy's pretty lips working overtime
trying to hold back the tears of disap-
| Pointment. Two’ or three times Mr.
‘| Pell-tried to begin his next speech be-

fore he -sudceedad.

““T wng thinking,” he sald, “in fact,
I've, thought it for,a long time—ever
since a little, while after you came to

front from Pellton much more of a
surprise than to get married. That

“Yes—but,” and the Ups worked
overtime, “I didn’t know there. was
