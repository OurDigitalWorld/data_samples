We appreciate the fact that our main-

we would like everyone to come along

As an auxfliary to our present coal
supply, and owing tothe fact that our
chances of obtaining -Mard coal this
winter are, thus far, ver¥ slim, several
of us who own base Durmérs and could
not use them last year-on account of
being without hard coal, will burn coal
oll gas in our heating stoves. The
heat from coal oll gas,“{t {s claimed,
is greater than. from coal or natural

those particularly Whoss base burners

able circumstances were heatless last

many. It has been: tried out in other

What Will You Do
For Help? |

ARM help is searce,
to a marked degree by-using machinés that accomplish
more work in a given time with less man power.
Why should the farmer cling, to horses—a slow, expensive -
means of power—when every other business is a opting
the truck and thereby reducing the cost, of hauling, speeding
up Gatveries, and saving for human needs the food that
e

orses would otherwise consume?

The motor driven track:can work constantly at maximum
load under the burning Summer sun, or in the coldest weather,
Unlike the horse it needs no rests while working, it eats only
while in actual use, and when the day’s work is done it
requires very littlé attention, and leaves you free for other
“Chores” about the place, Then,’ it ean be housed in one-
quarter the space of the horses, wagon and harness it replaces,

It is a mistaken idea that a truck is useful only for driving
upon paved roads. The Ford can be driven all over the farm,
and used for hauling grain, potatoes, fruit, roots, fertilizer,
wood; stock, milk or any other roduct. The speed it
travels, the time it saves, and its low upkeep cost appeal
very strongly to all users of the Ford Truck. If you need
help, order your Ford One Ton/Truck today.

A SUGGESTION FORTHE FARMER

The following article from tat well
edited paper the Picun Gazette con-
tains a suggestion that is just as valu-
;able to Essex County. -

“Tt the farmer of Prince Edward
could realizé how much pleasure it
j would give to many people who are
splendid drives
through all ports of the county to have
some means of knowing whose homes
they aro passing, they! surely vould
not be so careless about’ not having
their names plainly marked on their
rural maf] boxes. That) some of them
appreciate this themselves, was ovt-
denceéed by the fact tlt only a day or
two, ago one of Prince Edward’s pro
gressive farmers called at the Gazette
office’ with the suggestion that a cam-
paign be instituted to induce every
farmer to have his name plainly print-
ed on both sides of his mail box.

Needless to say this suggestion was
highly appreciated and was exactly
in line with what has’ often — been
thought of. It would mean only a few
minutes effort and would give great
pleasure to passersby if this sugges-
tion- was universally adopted. Prac-

 

 

has a mall box at his residence. The
owner's name is.not needed to {denti-
fy it. as far as the mail carrier Is con-
cerned, but it would givé great pleas-

very cheap and effectual way of adver-
tizing that ought not tobe neglected.

For th@\benefit of those who are
anxious to follow out this suggestion

 

‘it might be stated fhat there is noth-

ing better that can be used for this
purpose than printer's ink, A very
littla bit of this_commodity would
mark all the maf) boxeg in a nejghbor-
hood and a box stencilled with print-
er’s ink will, retain the name indefin-
itely.

COLD storage is a room
or building, depending upon
the size, cooled by ice or
by some mechanical meana,
In short, it is a place for keeping food
products cool in tho hot weather.
Since the farms produce the food
and since the cooling of {t should be
done quickly and immediately after
its production, say milk for example,
in order to keep it in good condition
as long as possible, would it not seem
good business and economy to have
the cold storage on the farm? This
applies to our farms particularly
since they produce such very per-
Ishable products as milk, butter,
eges, frult and meat. If there was

mo other advantage in having cold
storage on the farm than that it pro-

vides a place in which to keep the

dally victuals cool and sweet, there
would seem to be a good reason for
including it in the farm equipment.

There are many ways of providing
4 small cold storage on the farm, but
with the exception of very large fruit
or dairy farms, the same principle
applies to all, namely, that fice {9
used as tho.means of cooling. The {|
method of applying the ice to the
best advantage constitutes the prob-
Jem in each individual case. This Js
why no one system can be recom-
mended for all cases. It Js my inten-
tion to describe briefly below one
type which should give good service
in many farm homes,

The particular name of this sys-
tem is the Bunker system. ‘It con-
sists of a small room a few feet
Bquare with a bunker or box or rack
at one side for holding the cakes of
fee, It is separated from the room
by a partition which is kept a few
inches off the floor and likewise from
the ceiling. The bunker has a slat-
ted floor with pan just below to
catch water which is disposed of
readily through a drain. This ar-
rangement provides a natural means
for the cold air to drop down to the
floor, escape into the cooling room
Proper and for the warm air to pass
up over the partition to the ice, So
long as this bunker is kept supplied
with ice-there will be a natural flow
of cold air through the storage room.
If the room be well insulated Jt
should be possible to maintain a tem-
perature of about 40 deg. Fahrenheit
andatairly dryatmosphere. Those do-

municating with the writer. Inform-
ation and assistance will be freely

ACH year brings a_ certain
amount of +troublo through
the feeding of new grain to
live stock, and in seasons like
tho present when food 1s scarce and
the supply of old grain has been ex-
Me before tho freshly-threshed

grain is ready there is a likelihood
that more new grain than usual will
bo fed to the live stock and conso-
quently greater care should be exer-

cised to avold digestive derange-
ments,

The horse is generally considered

& little more susceptible to digestive
troubles following chitifes in fe,
ing practice than are” other clas
of farm live stock, It is alwaya well
to make changes véry gradually atid
carefully. The main grain foeds of
tho horse In this country is oats, and
new oats should always be fed with>
great care, Hard-worked horsea
should, if it is at all possible, be fed
old oats and the new grain left*to
dry and cure for o few weeks after
threshing. At any rate (0 avoid colic,
acule indigestion and inflammation
i new oats should at first form only a
part of the grain ration, being mixed
with old oats and possibly a little
bran and the percentage of the new
grain gradually increased until the
horses are on full feed: Sudden
changes from old to new grain aro
especially dangerous with the horse
and particularly with the horse at
heavy work and on a heavy concen-
trate ration. There is, of course, a
difference due to the*time of thresh-
ing. Grain which remains in stack
or mow for several weeks and thus
becomes dry and cured {fs not so
dangerous as that threshed directly
fromthe field or immedfittely after
harvesting,

As a rule heavy feeding of grain
is not practiced with cattle and sheep
on pasture. Where such {a the case,
however, changing from old to new
grain should be done with care and
the substitution should be, if pos-
sible, gradual. If tho ration must,
of necessity, be composed entirely of
newly-threshed grain it should ‘at
first be comparatively light and in-
creased very gradually. ‘

Pigs usually handlo newly-thresh-
ed grain’ without much trouble, al-
though if on very heavy rations when
finishing for

market‘a little care

thrown off their feed, Newly-thresh-
ed grain is diMcult to grind fine and
is not ensily stored and large quan-
tities of the ground graim may not
bo stored In bulk as heating and
musting will result In lowering the
feeding Value of fie grain by ren-
dering {t unpalatable and less digest-
ible. Musty grain is more dangerous
than clean, new grain.—Prof., W.
Toole, Ontario Agricultural College,
