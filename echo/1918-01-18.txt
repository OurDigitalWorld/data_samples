Having been accepted as _n pupil, I

Mr. Larramore showed me a number of
of young ladies from

pounced,upon a pretty girl whose ap-
pearante denoted amiability and ap-
pled for her. It happened that she
was not engaged. I was introduced to
her, and’ our drill wis commenced. T
was handed a printed slip which read
as follows;

“My dear, when I married you I sup-
posed I<was marrying you alone. I

had no intention of mnrrying yon

family.”

I was instructéd by Mr, Dateaniores

to’ speak theso words angrily to my
dunimy wife, I did so, and despite the
foct that Iwas playing a part I saw
the hot blood mount to her cheek. She
made no reply, for the ae 2 inter-
posed. »

“Those words should not tara been
uttered,” he said, “though they may
have been felt, 4When 4 man marries ~

only course thut suggested Itself to me
was this:

“It you Keep on thiking long enough
perhaps yowlH say something worth

At this our fistruetor called a tinlt.

“Where {s the error in this case?” he
asked me.

“Tho error {8 ju a woman's endicss
ebain of words.” wis my reply.

“Wrong! Your wife was simply let-
ting off stenm. The feminine nerves
are different from those of men, and a
frsband should recognize this.
should have let your wife talk until
she waa_talked out.”

“What! “Listen to that rubbish?
Where do {he husband's nerves come
in?” ‘

“Tlis port is t6 lenve the room quict-
jy and without banging the. door be-
bind him.”

“See here, professor,” I began angri-
ly. “I'd have you understand"’—

“Recess,” Interrupted the professor,
and opened the door of a pleasant lit-
tle room, in which there were flowers
and birds and pictures on subjects con-
duclve to happy emotions. “Go in
{here and make up.”

“What a pretty room!” sald my hypo-
(hetient wife, a smile breaking over her
pretty lps.

“Dellghtfuit” I assented.

We were left together for some time,
longer thnn 1 thought*necessary for
practice Ii reconciliation between hus-
band nd wife, though altogether too
short( for a palr of lovers. Indeed,. £
would not have objected to o much
longer period. Mr, Larramore sum-
moved us to new marital trials, dpolo-
gizing for leaving us so long.

“We have a room in which we put
extremely amlable couples,” be said,

“for the se est test that can bo ap-
plied. It furnished throughout in
red. The reason for my delay in your
case is (hat I put a couple in’ tho red
room, and there regulted such a bitter
quarrel that it required al} my strength
to separate them. Never furnish a
room in red; it excites animosity.”

“What did you do with this couple?”
I askéd.

“They are now
billing and cooing.’

~“May I ask, professor, ~vbat propor-
tion of divorces your tibles indicated
are mother-in-law cases?”

“Ninety per cent.”

“Ts jt the-mofher-in-Inw virus alone
that produces the trouble or are there
other ingredients?”

“Quito often there are other ingre-
dients, but it Is safe to say that-with
the mother-in-law removed 75 per cent
of such cnses would pull through.”

“What is the best anti-toxin,” I ask-

ed, “for a wife on the verge of trans-
ferring ber affections to masher man?’

“Another woman.’

“And 1 suppose my Bypeteetical
wifé's part in the anti-toxin for a hus-
band infatuated with another woman
than his wife is nvother man?”

“Only as a Inst resort.” replied the
professor. “The interference of the
other man {s Hable to throw a stiin on
tlie wife.”

“Mrs. Larramore was passing, and ber
‘husband referred the question to her.

“The tredtment of a husband infatu-
ated by another woman,” she safd.\“re-
quires more self control than any other

to ignore the infatuation and not ap-
penr Jealous, for the man is pretty sure
to tiré of the other woman tn time, “A.

Professor Larramore recommenced |

his drilliog in the matrimonial manuals,
but the practice was rather on points
calculated to bring about trouble than
those in which o quarrel bad got under

“Because our former making up was
so delightful that I wished to make up
over again.”

1 was drilled with my hypothetical
wife in avolding matrimonial whirl-*
pools twice a week for six weeks, at
the end of which time we were cack
given a certificate that we were master’
