ter of Labor in the Laurier Govern-
ment, was unanimously nominated as
a straight Laurier candidate for the
Honse of Commons at a largely attend-
ed meeting of the North York Reform
Association held at Newmarket Sat-
urday afternoon. It has been stated
that John Armstrong, ex-M. P., has
been induced to forego Conservative
nomination dn this riding im favor of
Hon. N. W. Rowell.

Depressing statistics about the Joss-
es in war conic not so frequently from
soldiers themselves but »mainly from
civilians who have never, as the ald:
fashloned feller used to say, even shot
off an ash barrel. Harold BR, Peat,
who recently served two years with
the first. Canndian — contingent, and
whose Hook, “Private Peat,” is now
available, says; “The worst part of
the war's over, whether’ It lasts six
months or.six years longer, because
you fellows (the Americans) will go
over there knowingthat the Germans
are licked. Only one man in 25 gets
killed, and that’s pretty cheap to get
to seeathe biggest circus in the world.”

"$5,500,000 IN BONDS.

George Wegennsi, the’ manager of

the report that the company will sib-
scribe $3,000,000 to the Victory Doan.
This amount is ‘an entirely new dub-

ready subscribed to Canadian war

Mr, ,Denike ehtered a Vigorous pro-
tést against accepting tenders for
next year's paving now, and. moved a
resolution against the acceptance of
Any fender. -Speaking to his motion,
je drew attention to the ehanging
conditions, and*the fact that if the war
continues there will be no money for
local improvements, and declared that
if money’ were tb be spent better to
use it in purchasing aright of way or.
somp other {nducement for the Essex
Terminal Railway from’ the Quarry to
Amherstburg. +

Moved, in amendment, by Mr, Crim-
ming, seconded by Mr Allen; that the
tender be. left on the table till next

fippointed to wait in the ,Mercliants on
Dalhousie and Murray Streets to na-
certain’ their wishes in regard to pay-
ing.
