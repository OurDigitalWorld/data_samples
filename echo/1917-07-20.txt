John Auld, Esq.,

My very dear John:

I have been intending to
write you a letter for a-lbng time. In
fact, when I whs way down an Lemnos
Island In the Agean Sea, f began a Tet-
ter to you which contained a narrative
of my dolngs and manoegverings from
the time of reaching Enktand with my
old Unit until 1 landed af Lemnos, Un-
fortunately, I was stricken with
very severe fllness, two fionths after
|I reached the latter placa, which upset
}all my plans, and, incidéntally, came
within an ace of causlbg my death.

 

Faro. H. A. Davis, /Just as T had gotten things in good} among us to such an extent.that at one
!running order, I took toimy bed. One!

{day I called Pte. Mossie Winters (now
}a sergeant), the omnipteseut, omni-
|clent, ubiquitous and notorious scribe
lof the Evening Record, to my tent and
jasked him if The Bcho Bnd a. corres-
}pondent with the Unit. When We in-
formed me-that such was not the case,
I told him that I would ¢bnatitute and
{appoint myself its representative, he
|to look after the Recor, and I, the
Echo, but {t was a case of nian pro-
poses and God disposes. ‘I. became too
}ilbto write. 5

By this time, my dedr, John, you
must be well-posted and informed of
all the things that have; happened to
|me, personally, and to my Unit, from
the time we left, Canada, which was

Fr} the 15th April, 1915, until. we reached

| England and settled down in Shorn-
cliffe on 29th April, 19175. You no
doubt know my Unit, then No; 3, Con-
adinn Stationary. - Hospital, opened
Moore Barracks. hospital, and: carried
on there for three montad with me as
Sureeon-in-charge. Talsg had charge
of the surgery in thé adjoining hos-
pital@.viz., Shorneliffe Military ‘Hos-
pital,-where all the surgicg! cases arisy
ing among the Canadian Units in that
district were sent for operation. At
the ‘expirationof that time, and hay-
Ing proved to the entire satisfaction
of the military authoritice that my
Unit, officers and men alike, werg cap-
able of carrying on “hospital mnnage-
ment in all its deatnll ther in Eng-

commiumication, or at the base, and
also to select a suitable site for the
T was not
longs away before I was ordered bick
to England. On my landing, I was
ordered to the Dardanelles, The rea-
son given for this change of program,
as far as I was concerned, was that
two other O. C.'s of Canadian Units,
when ordered to)procéed to the Dardn-
nelles, positively and emphiitically re-
fused to go. The War Office, which
waa for court-martinling these recalc}-
trant and disobedient Units, at the

+|earnest solicitation of General Jones,

accepted two other Units to take their
places. My-Unit was one of the’ Jat-
ter. When’I was ordered to go, 1
obeyed at once, because I-felt the first
duty of a soldier is obedjence to his
superior authdrity. The game must
jbe played in face of all hazards, and
every risk must be Chanced, You also
no doubt know that on August Ist,
1915, we sailed from Southampton on
board the hospital ship Asturias, since
torpedoed and sunk, and reached Alex-
andria, Egypt. 12 days after, stopping
;at Malta on the way down. The, trip
(through the Mediterranean was~ un-
eventful, but most pleasant. The
weathér was glorious; the sea, as blue
as indigo, was calm and placid as a
thirror. The aun shone -all day, and
the firmanent was dotted with myriads
of stars at tight, riyalling in light, ef-
fulzente and brilliancy, the -moon,
Little did one think, as, surrounded on
all sides with so mich calm and silent
Nenuty, that the sea with its beautiful
Wiue and placid waters, would become
the gmveyard of s0 many brave souls,
While the sud was at its zenith in the
Horizon, and that, beneath the gaze of
‘he twinkling stars, such harrowing

Scenes would take place. ‘

ashe was torpedoed and sunk on Sat-
urdsy afternoon, August 14th, 1916,
with a loss of 1,300 lives. We were
following in her waké, which was the
shortest route to Mudros, our course
lying between Caros and~ Carpathos.
On the Sunday morning following, at
6 a.m., we were signalled by s French
torpedo boat destroyer to stop. We
did so {mmediately. The captain
bourded our ship, and not being able
to speak English, I acted as _inter-
preter for him. He told us of our dan-
} eer, that two submarines were lurking
in the neighborhood and waiting for
jus, He advised the captain of our
j ship to alter his course, which was, to
} retrace the hoat’s steps a distance of
| 125 miles. We acted accordingly and
+ zig-zagged alk the way to our destin-
ation, which we reached {in safety on
i 17th of August at 4.00 p.m.

was erected to accommodate 300 pa-

away. The reception and lodging of
this number of patients, so soon after
our arrival, was considered by Inspec-

Wherever you find Ford’ cars and Ford service, you find
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who eppreciate the car

for its quick starting, {ts easy control; {ts simplicity and
its extrnordinary capacity for hard work. : *

The phenomenally large sale of Ford, cars {s the direct
result of Ford SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION. ,
Fer, satisfaction is'os universal os-the Ford car itself:

. Doctors, lawyers, salosmen, bakers, grocers and farmers
all praise the Ford—all‘are satisfied.

Its-low cost appeals to them. Its.unusually low upkeep
cost pleases them. Its sturdy, steady, service-giving char-
acter wins them and satisfies them. Even the wealthy
prefer to dnive Ford cars rather than bot) <r with the cost-
ly, cumbersome limousine and chauffeur, It means econ-
, omy when “soving’is a national duty.”

Ford satisfaction is just as valuable as upholstery, or ao
fancy finish. Ask any Ford owner about it. 3

If yow intend to buy a Ford, place your order with the
nearest dealer.

VINES FOR SHADE.

What to Chooso to Soreen Your Porch
or Your Back Fence.

Vines for shading purposes require
dense growth. One of the ways to get
this after the proper ones baye been
selected is to insure good soll, plenty
of water and frequent cultivation)
Vines must make,their growth quickly
and uninterruptedly to. make good
screening or shading, and for this rea-
son hardy perennial ones are best.

To show rapid top growth a vine
must-huve a large root mass. This
con be assured by planting in a spe
clally prepared trench or pit excavated
to a depth of eighteen inches. - If the
subsoil is hardpan or sticky clay,
drainage materia) consisting of broken
stones, large clinkers from the furnace
or other mineral rubbish should be
put in the bottom toa depth of three
inches.

 

 

Densq growing vines are gross feed--

ers and soon exhaust the gojl{i the
trenches if it is not naturally good and
kept up yearly. All those recommend-
ed prefer a sofl with an alkaline :re-
action, which is secured ‘by the use of

lime.- If a good soll is not available |

mako one from chopped up sods or
good gurden loam, adding one-third
the bulk of well rotted horse manore.

For screening a north porch there is
nothing better than the Dutchman's
pipe vine (aristolochin), a vigorous and
rapidly growing vine, bearing when

October last. The ceremony will be
conducted by Clare Jarvis, of Londop,
assisted by members from the vari-

During the storm Saturday after-
noon Mghtning struck 4 tree under
which Wm. Menzies, Leslie Shepley
and his nephew Harold were stand-
{ng on the Menzies property. It gave
both Mr. Shepley and his nephew a
very severe shock, in fact for some
time it looked as if Mr, Shepley had
been killed. .Upon examination, Mr.
Menzies found life and immediately
worked over him, bringing him .to
within an hour sufficient: to walk to
his car with assistance, and he was
taken to his home, where he Iaid un-

Menzies escaped uninjured is explain-

rubber boots. ° It was -‘® very close

Looking back over the past three

stop and ask ourselves if such awful

just at the beginning of this terrible

Mrs, Dan Lauzon and children, of

Mrs, Remi Bondy.

Miss Rena Bondy has returned home
after spending five months in Wind-
sor. She has~secured-a position as
bookkeeper with_Wm. Wall, atgthe
Quality Canning Factory.

The Bodtd of Trustees for the Mc-
Gregor Separate school met on Satur-
day last and passeda by-law providing
for the issue of debentures to the am-
ount of $1,000, to supplement the $5,-
000 first raised, to complete the build
ing of the school house in the united
sections. When this work was first
projected, the Board thought that $6,-
000 would-be sufficient, bit owing to
the advance in the price of building
material and‘Iabor, it was found that
when the contract was let it had $1,-
000 too little money for the purpose. .
The by-law is published for the first
time in this issue of The Echo, and a3
goon as the publications are complet-
ed, debentures will be issuedyso as to
take care of.the Dill already Contract-
ed. The work of rebullding «the
school is progressing favorably, and
as anticipated the building ought to
be ready for the reception of scholars
very soon after holidays. Sey

morning following an illness of a year
with heart trouble. , ,Deceased was
born in. Amherstburg and was a son
of the late Capt..Joseph Biron. Of
the family only one brother survives,
Charles Biron, painter, Mr. Biron spent
the greater portion of his Ife inthis
town. He was married two years ogo
to the widow of the late George Gren-
jer, and they made their home in De-
troit and Windsor until six months
ago, when his condition became so
serious that they returned to Amherat-
burg. Mrs. Biron and infant daughter
will have the sympathy of the com-
munity.
