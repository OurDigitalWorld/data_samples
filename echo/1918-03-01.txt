LEGISLATIVE NOTES.

To line with the suggestion of Mr,

of the Ontario License Board has been
made, Mr. McDonald has pointed out
the saving which could be effected in
this .way.and sugested that with the
Temperance Act. in force five mem-
Ders. were not required. The. Board
has been reduced to three, which will
save to thé@*Provinoe between $58,000
and $10,000 a year.

by Mr. Proudfoot.,toy remove the dis-

Wiliam Hearst tdd the members of
the Legisiature o. Thursday after-
noon. The schoo)s in Essex and Kent
counties are complying with the regu-
lations, the Premier said, and-there {s
a general improvement in the northern
part of the province. The Government
finds that the cief difficulty is the lack
of teachers with the necessary qualifi-
cations to teact in these schools,

The Attorney-General told S. Du-

is expected by this amendment that clarme (North Essex) that aH the

45,000 additional troops will be se-,
cured. Toronto's share ip estimated |
at 2,500, or two and a half battalions |
at war strength.

The military authorities estimate
that a total of 75,000 troops will be
obtained by calling out the first class
under the Act. This estimate, of
conrse, is based upon the expectations |
that the qnestion of exemptions in
Quebec will te cleared up fairly and
impartially. Jt also includes volun-
teers coming in continually from the
United States. A similar amendment
has already been introduced in the
United States, but the age set Is 21

amount in the «estimates of $100,000 to
be msed for general grants and con-
tingencies. Heretofore afl of the
schools have not received the full am-
ount of their grants from the Govern-

Z. Mageaw (Sturgeon Falls) was not
satisfied with the information given
by the Ministers. He wanted to know
If all the schools would benefit by the
grant, particularly those in which
English and French are taught. Hon.
Mr. Lucas and the Prime Minister par-
ried that any information desired
could be secured, and that they were
not conversant with the details.

Mr. Mzageau protested that the Min-
ister of Lands, Forests and Mines, nit-
ing for the Minister of Education, last
year, put questioners off in the same
way, for fear capital would-be made
out of the information.

“I won't allow the honorable member
to say that.” retorted Sir William
Hearst, warmly. “He can ask for the
information when the main estimates

OHIO NEEDS SEED CORN.
Crop of 1917 Has Little Value for
Planting This Spring.

Most of tho ‘corn harvested In Ohio |

inj 1917 is not fit for seed, according
to the Okfo Experiment Station, which |
has been testing nczriy two thou and i
somples representing almost every
county in the state. Crib and field
lots range in germination from 1 to 40
per cent.

Corm gathered anc stored under
artificial drying conditions before the
freézing weathor last Dseembor show
90 to. 100 per cent.-germfnction In these
tests. Half of the corn kept from the
crop of 1916 tests that hich, and three:
fourths of such ccmpleg arc above 80}
per cent.

Sced corn this sprig must come
from throe sources: A few farmers
stored thelr coin carly so/ that it was
well dried out when cold weather
came. Some corn matured compara-
tively carly in couthern counties and
can be used in that part of the State.
All old corn from 1916 siould be held
for seed and tested for germination.

Since Jocal secd corn is always
safest, the Experiment Station advises |
{ermiers to buy ag near home as pds-
sible and to test cach car. before
Planting. The “rag doll” test is easily
made at home, A cloth Apout 10 by
60 inches is-marked off in 40 squares ;
in each of which cre placed six kernels
irom an ear numbered to correspond
with the number siyven the speco on
the cloth. :

The cloth isrolled up, soaked in
water 3 to 10 hours and placed in a
warm room.. In akont a week | the
count can be made for food ears, and
tlliprovins poor in &crmination can be
discarded,

THE» EDITORIAL WASTE BASKET

(K'ingston Whig.)

The wastepaper basket in a news-
paper office’is an unsightly and unin-
teresting thing.” Size’ is its most ne-
cessary qualifcation.: Yet, that same
waste paper basket humblé and ‘hateful
as it appears, serves a great purpose.
It is an unassuming medium fraught
with marvellous possibilities for good.
No- other agency, except perchance the
fear of the law and the! hereafter,
does so much to keep peace in the fam-

The report was adopted.

Mayor Park gave notice of motion
for a-standard milk by-law, controlling
the sale of milk.

Mr. Wigle wanted to know if there

had been’any inquiry into whether the
Essex Terminal Road purposed com-
ing into Amherstburg and the advis-
ability of “the council appointing~ a
committee to wait on the management
with a view to urging them to extend
their line from the quarry here.
. Mayor: Park sald that a few weeks
ago he ‘had interviewed Mr, Woollatt,
and that the company had no present
intention of coming té Amherstburg,
nor of carrying passengers,

Mr. Wigle urged that*a representa-
tive. committee should be appointed.
He had been told that Mr, Woollatt
informed one of Ambherstburg’s. repre- |
sentative citizens that it was “theirin-
tention to extend their line into Am-
herstburg when the time cume,

Reeve Brown corroborated what the
Mayor had said.. He had also-spoken
to Mr. Woollatt, and recelved no en*
couragement.

Mr. Wigle again pressed tNe matter,
because as the-switching charges were
absorbed by the trunk tines, and as
these trunk lines are other than the
M. C. R. he believed it would mean
saying of several thousand dollars a
yehr to the merchants of Amherstburg
to have this line enter the town.

He urged that. ~a representative
bunch of citizens get up close to the
Essex Terminal Railway and press our
claims upon them;

Reeve Brown moved that. this coun-

tion from Guelph re a compulsory poll
tax.

The mation was seconded by Mr.
Craig and cafried.

Mr. Crimmins introduced adiscns-
sion on the new method of collection

C, “A. Cuddy/addressed the council
with reference to a fixed assessment
on the Lake View Hotel to permit the
proprietor to re-open his hotel under
the new conditions without lIcense.
He urged the council to meet Mr. Fox
fairly so as to encourage a good ho-
tel, which was badly needed here.

Mayor Park—“Is Mr.. Fox prepared
to. nome a reasonable price for the
sale ‘of his hotel?”

Mr, Guddy—“Yes, he is.”

Mayor- Park thought ‘it might be
feasible for the municipality to take
over the hotel and run it forthe muni-
cipalty, as-is done in other towns.
Sometimes the burden of taxation is
relleved in this way.

Mr. Cuddy—"I'd want to take about
10 cents worth of the stock. Mr, Fox
quotes the Lake View at $15,000, which
is below the mark.” A

Reeve Brown—“If the town gave
him any concessions he should be pre-
pared to agree to keep the place open
the year round.”

Mr. Cuddy—“That-svould=be part of
the agreement.”

Mr. Rutherford addressed the coun-
cil regarding the proposed water pro-
position of the Brunner, Mond. At
both the public meetings, held to dis-
cuss this matter, he had been assured
by the buginess men and ratepayers
that he could go ahead and purchase
material for the waretworks and the
proposition would go through. “but.
there was now a rumor that the peo-
ple were showing considerable oppo-
sition. He thought inasmuch as he
had been given’ the assurance of the
meetings that the proposition was ac-
ceptable to them’ and only to wait for
the new voters’ list, that the by-law

urged that the question be submitted
fo the people and let them say whether
they want it on not.

Mayor Park—*Mr, Dallyn has prom-
ised to be here at the earllest possible
date and discuss this with the town
from all standpoints.”

Mr. Denike thought the people had
no chance yet to Took into any alter-
native proposition, because —we have

BY-LAW No.

A By-Law to provide for Drainage Work in the. Township of Colchester South, in the
County of Essex, and for borrowing on the oredit of the Municipality tho eum of
Four Hundred’ and Ninoteen. Dollars and Thirty Cents for compi@ting the same.
Provisionally adopted the 4th day of February, A. D, 1918.

Whereas the majority in number of the resident and non-resident owners (exclusiv
of farmers’ sons not actual owners), as shown by the last revised Assessment Roll,
tle property hereinafter set forth to be benefitted by drainage work, that 1s to say,
by constructing a tile drain along Queen Street in the Village of Harrow, have petition
ed the Council of the a. Township ofColchester South praying (at the Jands on thé
East sido of- Queen Street In the Village of Harrow, from Munger Avetiue to the Philip,
Ferriss Dratn,.1 be drained by means of a Tile Drain. ’

And where: thereupon the said Council has procured an examination to be made
by Jz.J. Nowman, being a | perso ompetent for such purpose, of the said area pro-

osod to be drained, and the supRested foruthe drainage thereof, and of other
ands and roads liable to assessment under the Municipal Drainage Act, and has also
procured plans, specifications and estimates of the drainage work to be made by the
said J, J. Newman and an assessment to be made by him of the Jands and rouds to bo
Deneftted-by such drainage work, and of other lands and roads liable for contribution
thereto, stating a8 nearly a5 hoe can the proportion of benefit} outlet lability and Injur-
foe liability which, In tis opinion, will be derived or-incurred in consequence of such
drainage work by every road and lot, or portion of lot, the said assessment so made
being the sment hereinafter by this by-law enactéd to besassessed and levied upon
the roads lots, or. parts OF lots, hereinafter in that behalf specially set forth and
described; id the report of theesaid J:°J. Newman th respect. thereof, and of the sajd

drainage work being a5 follows
Windsor, Ont., October 29th, 1917.

To the Reeve and Municipal Council of the Township of Colchester South;—

Gentlemén,—In. compliance with your instructions, | have made an examination,
survey, report, ete., of the drain petitioned for by Thomas Vincent afd others, and now
report theron as follows;

1 commenced my survey at the Philip Ferriss Drain on the East’side of Queen Street.
Thence J followed none the East side of Queen Street to the, Northerly, side of Munger
Avenue, in the Police Village of Harrow. y

I find that there is at present a 12“ Ule drain from the Philip Ferriss Drain (6 &
point about feet south thereof at the catch basin near the Jine between the lands of
Gordon Arner and W. H. Ferriss,. From the last mentioned point to the Southerly side
of Sinasac Avenue there has been a 7 tile drain constructed, Dut thts fast Wontioned
drain is so shallow and so poorly that it, in Tact, is of very little benent to the
lands it was intended to drain, and a& a consequence the Jands Soush of tho Pere Mar-
quette Railway are flooded with every small freshet that comes,

In order.to overcome this diMculty, and thus afford proper Graifiage to the lands
and roads affécted,.f would pommend that a 12‘ tile drain be constructed from the
catch basin near thé line bet nh the Iands of Gordop Arner and W. H. Ferriss to the
catch basin at the Southerly side of Sinasac Avenue, and a 7" tile drain be constructed
from the last mentioned point tothe ny ser ly, side of Munger avenue, all as shown on

ns
Ssary tO construct a» drain under the tracks of
Sewer crock laid in concrete, as shown on the

a7

the accompanying profile and eine

I further find that it will be
the Pere Marquette Rallrosd with
accompanying profile. . - .

festimate the cost of construeting this portion of the drain at the sum of $150,00,
1 estimate the cost of constructing 12" farm tile drain for the same distance at the
sum of $13.80, making a difference in cost, the sum of $136.20. This Jast mentioned
amount [shave pssed against the Pere Marquette Railroad Company to be barne and
contrbuted by it in case jt does not, exoreise its option of constructing the said. drain
within @ reasonable time and without unnecessary delay.

Should the Rallway Company construct=the drain under the tracks above men-
tloned, then the Township will Jv 4 to the sald Company the sum of $13.80,

My estimate of the cost of the whole of the above work,‘ together with all inci-
dental expenses, except the Pere Marquette Railroad crossing, is ine sum of $419.30.
Of this amount I have assessed the lands which.are benofitted by or use the said drain
A3 Bh Outlet, with the sum of ¥ .00, and the Hevesi of Colchester South: for roads
with the: sum of $133.30, as more fully set forth in the schedul of assessmopt
hereto attached. _ :

I would further recommend that this drainago work bo kept up and maintained at
tho éxpense of tho lands and roads herein assessed for its construction, and in the pro-+
bol did rain contained until otherwise determined by the report of an engineer under
the provisitiins of the Municipal Drainage Act,

AccoMinanying this report you will find a copy of this report, plansand specifica-
tions for Me purpose of securing the approval of the Railway Commission, shiuld it bo
found NeCOAsarysto ure such approval before the Pere Marquette Railway will con-
struct the dirain under their tracks.

All Of Swhich is respectfully submitted.

Tho Provinces {jn Which the yotes
have so far been sounted aro Ontario,
Quebec and Nova Scotia.

Tlie effect of the vote in tho two
former provinces has been compara-
tively insignificant, only one Ontario
seat haying really been cndangered. In
Quebec {t {s doubtful whether even the
oversens yote Will create any differ-
ences, In Novi Scotia, however, the
soluiers’ vote of this side has shorn
down several Liberal majorities to a
point where the overseas soldiers’ vote
will almost assuredly wipo them out,

Seven Changes Likely.
From present indications there will

be seven changes, inchiding the elec-
tion of Mr. Speaker Rhoces, Liberals
who aro almost certain to bo defeated
include Olver in W/est Edmonton, At-
iimin South Esse#,. McKav in Pictou,
Martel in Hants, Carroll in Richmand
and South Cape Breton, and probably
Kyte in the same eoastituency, though
he still has a fair jead over his oppon-

ents. :
The soldiors’ vor? averaged about 85

per cent. for the Government. In Nova
Scotin, however, there was 1 greater
‘proportion for the Opposition than in
the ather Province. In North Cape
Breton, for instance, D. D. Mackenzie,
the Laurier candidate, sceured 77 sol-
dier votes to McCormack’s 108, which
is nearly 60 per cent. of the tutal, |

It is interesting; to note. that in

him personally; in Welland, where no-
aed was @ndorsed, Fraser secitred 106

The Quebe Poll.

In Quebec ‘the ‘soldiers’ voto polléd

wirere McMartin, the Laurier candi-
date, is leading by @80-“at’ present,
Draper, his opponent, secured 55 sol-

In Chambly-Vercheres, where up-
wards of 1,200 soldiers’ votes were
“Jocated;” Rainville, the Govornment
candidate, and former_deputy-speaker,
could only squeeze ot 127 after the
