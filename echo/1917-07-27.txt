For the Jast fiécal year ending March 27th, 1917, The William Davies Com-

y bought and killed 1,043,000 head of Live Stock (Cattle, Hogs and Sheep.)
This, plus purchases of outside Meats, produced 160,000,000 pounds of Meats,
The Company handled 6,550,000 pounds of Butter and Cheese, 5,650,000 dozens
of Eggs, and manufactured 26,500,000 tins of Canned Goods. :

The net profits on these were .68 cents (or'two-thirds of a cent) per pound on
meats, 1,04 cents on Butter and Cheese, 1.04/cents per dozen on Kgzs, and .47
cents (or slightly less than one-half a cent) per tin on Ganned Goods. These
profits include profits on all By-Products derived from these”accounts,

During the year the Company served at its retail stores 7,500,000 customers,
the average purchase of each customer was 35c,, and the net profit upon each

sale was 5-8 of 1 cent. J

The turnover of the Company from all its operations for the last fiscal year
ending March 27th, 1917, was $40,000,000,~ The nct percentage of profit upon

~Respecting the Report of the Commissioner on the Cost of Living:—

Last: Winter the Commissioner, undcr authority of
Order-in-Council, required packers to submit statements
under oath for some years back and up. to December Ast,
1916, of incoming stocks of Meats and the cost of sucti, as
well as statements of outgoing product and the selling value.
This Company represented in writing at the time that the
information as ‘specifically required’ wag not in accordance
with Packing” House Accounting methods, and invited: the
Commissioner to send an Officer to the Head Office of the
Company to examine the books for any information desired,

‘ and to secure a: viewpoint as to the best Wway_of collecting

data which would be of use to the Government, ‘This offer
was declined, and there was nothing to do but fill in the in-
formation -required:.as literally as we could determine it.
For example, there was no recognition of the fact that a
raw product may enter a factory under a spccifi¢ classification
and Icave the factory as a finished product under some other
classification. :

We submitted a series of accurate figures based pon our
inte: tation of the official requirements which made no
provision, for charges of: any description other than incoming”
freight arid unloading charges to be included in the ost or
to be deducted from the selling price. There was nothing
in the report which could be read so as to determine @ profit
and loss statement. The very fact that with only a statenient
based upon cost of raw products and value of sales int Great
Britain a Government Official has deduced “Large margins,”
“Profitocring” and “Criminality” if it had occurred since
the passage of a recent Act, shows too dangerous a trifling
and incapacity to be permitted to deal with any important
situation. The statements of this Company have been treated:
by the author of this ‘report as if the dut-going Product was
identical with the incoming product, and from. the. séries of
reports hie has singled out two items—the ‘Bacon and Ese.
reports—and from them deduced an erroneous “margin”
which the newspapers have interpreted as)“ profit.”

mental knowledge of simple bookkeeping and ‘a. dangerous
inability to co-ordinate figures, The following are spccific
and outstanding errors in the report: " ‘

cold storage bacon. ‘The term ‘‘cold-storage”” is not defined,
and the public is allowed to mate its own definitions. “As all

Firms didnot submit statements of their complete stecks,

out this cold-storage distinction to Mr. O'Connor and Miss

the distinction gftcr having had it pointed out evidences luck
of desire [6r-a¢curacy of the real information desired.

Itis true The William Davies Company, in 1916, exported
97,791,000 pounds of Bacon, but we do not know how tle
margin of 5.05 cents per pound is arrived at by Mr. O'Connor,
as there were no figures to justify such.a Conclusion. “The
probabilities are that the margin is arrived at by taking the
average cost per pound of incoming product from the average
selling price per pound of outgoing product: ‘This may be
B rough way of estimating the gross margin when dealing
Withsamall figures, but when dealingewith figures the size
that Mr: O'Connor has to deal with, a Very small fraction of
a cent per pound of error makes a very important difference
in the total, and one must be careful to make Sure that the
outgoing product is the eame finished merchandise of the
incoming product reported on,

Allowing it to pass, however, as a rough estimate, we
wish to point out—<(first)—the inquiry of the Commissioner
allowed only for incoming freight and. unidading charges,
and made no provision whatsoever for Operting charges of
any kitid, stich ag labor, curing materials, refrigeration, et

the actual cost to land ‘and sell this 07,791,000 pounds inEng-
land after leaving the packing house, whith involved charges
of 2.9 cents per pound—or $2,836,000. -Thus 2.9 cents per
pound included inland and ocean freight, landing. charges, war
and marine insurance, cables, and selling commission toagents.
The ocean freight and war risk alonewould make up 24
cents of the charge of 2.0'cents per pound. This 42 cents,

to determine net profits... Tad ‘ .

Everything Points to Higher Prices on all Cotton Goods :

Through the steadily increasing cost of materials and difficulties in deliveries of goods, through the
‘shortage and enormous cost of labor, embargoes on railways, shortage af eotton crop, and steadily increasing
high prices and demand for same on the mills for cotion cloth of all kinds, and the increasing demand

through the general prosperity of all classes of labor, and the last but most important factor is the UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT coming into the market for enormous quantities of Cotton, both raw aud manu-

 

factured.

When.used as a pawder the quantity

On small tobacco before it begins to
lap across the row four and one halt
pounds per acre is usually sufficient;
on largér tobacco six pounds per acre
is necessary.

powder and in order to get {t thor-

RECORD CROWD AT TRACKS.

 

Acording to a preliminary report of
the Provincial Government, prepared

‘by Messrs. Clarkson, Gordon: &  Dil-

worth, accountants, the attendance at
\the race tracks this year has-been
larger than "in any! year in@their his-
‘tors. The Government will — collect
& tfiteeg- per canty more in amuse-
ment tax irom race trick admissions
this year than Jast year. This is due
to the increase in® from ten to
twenty-five cents, and the larger at-
tendance. Although race track bet-
