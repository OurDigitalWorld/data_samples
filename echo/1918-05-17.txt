—The boys who work on farms this
summer wil] learn one thing that the
old stable of square measure omitted
the number of aches in an acre.

=Parkhill Gazette: “We are®told
that {t does not pay a farmer to rifise
hogs any more, Two men in Parkhill
who raised hogs summer’ think
differently. Each of these men raised
two hogs and bought practically every-
thing. the hogs ate. Each man sold
one hog and saved the other hog for!
the use of his family. In each Case.
not dnly.did the one hog,which was
sold pay for the ¢xpen
the two hogs but there

—Tiie cancellation of all exemptions
of men between the ages of 20 and
22 is seriously affecting the railroads
in London, Ont., and officials there of
both the C.P.R. and Grand Trunk are
finding {t a difficult task -to fill the
places of men drafted. The Grand
Trunk is more seriously affected than
any other road passing through the
city, as 12 telegraph operators in that
district will have to report for ser-
vice during the next couple af weeks.
So far the chief despatcher has not
been able to find operators ta take the
laces of the drafted men and it is
quite possible that a number of offices
will have to be closed. Several of the
brakemen have also been ordered to
report. Farming is not the only indus-
try struck hard by the new draft law.
*“—A despatch from Guelph says:—
“Farmers of this district. who pur-
chased large quantities of flour re-
cenfly expect to have to return it, in
compliance with the ruling of the food
boar. Many of the farmers had
enough flour to do them for a year.
A G6vernment inspector has been in
the district for several) days. Quite
a number of Guelph citizens who laid
in larger stocks of flour than the law
allows will have to take it back also.
A case In Puslinch township is being
cited here. About a year ago a farmer
purchased about 200 bags of flour, it
is stated, for which he paid $6.50 per
hundred. It is stated that he has
been notified by the Dominion auth-
orities that the greater part of the
flour must be-shipped without delay
to Montreal. from which port it will
be sentoverseas, where it is badly
needed. The man endeavored to se-
cure a fuli carload of flour at the
time he bought the other, itis stated.
The thing which hits him the hardest,
however, Is that he must accept the
pr nt market price, which is $6.”

OR SELF- POISONING

“FRUIT-A-TIVES” Absolutely Pre-
vents This Dangerous Condition.

The chief cause of poor health is
our neglect of the bowels, Wasto
matter, instead of passing from the
lower intestine regularly every day,
is allowed to remain there, generating
poisons which are absorbed by the
blood.

In other words, a person who is
habitually constipated, is poisoning
himself. We know now that Auéo-
intoxication, due to non-action of the
bowels, is: directly. responsible for
serious Kidney and Bladder Troubles;
sthat it upsets the Stomach, causes
Indigestion, Loss+of Appetite and
Sleeplessness; that chronic Rheum-
atism, Gout, Pain In The Back, dre
relieved as soon as the bowels become
regular; and that Pimples, Rashes,
Eczema and other Skin Affections
disappear when ‘Fruit-a-tives” are
taken to correct Constipation.

NEW SYSTEM OF WRITING COM-)
ING IN?

 

“Print” Method Adopted. in Some of

the London Schools.

 

Several London schools have al
duced a new system of writing known
as. “manuscript” or “print” writing,
which- replaces thé former vertical or
Spencerlan systems. In thenew sys-
tem the children imitaté the form of
printed charictéra, and jt is claimed
that the task of learning to write
legibly is greatly shortened and sim-
plified by the ‘leaving out of the un-
necessary connecting tpstrokes.

The new system was © first intro-

duced in military,estailishments for
convalescent soldiers, originating in
the desire to find a method of writing
which could .be quickly learned ‘by sol-
diers who had lost the use of their
right hand, Its advoeates claim that
the “print” writing as easy to learn,
neat, legible and speedy, and ‘that ‘it
| removes the, great disadvantages of
two kinds of letters with which the
child has to contend jn learning to
read and to write

In a pamphlet issued by the Child
Study Society of London, Dr. .L. ¢C;
Kimmins, chief inspector of the Lon-
don Education Department, calls the

new system “the writing of the~ fu-
ture.”

HOW To KEEP WEIL 3 CIAL
wom arrears lf fa

   

NLY THE RICH can adorn themselves with rare and costly jewels,
but the finest, most useful, and most attractive of all jewelea—
good testh—are within the reach of everyone. Good teetir are
not only a factor of personal adornment, but their value is much

greater as a means of protection against disease. -

Why does one never see a poor, grouchy dyspeptic. with a set of good
teeth? Poor, broken-down teeth cannot properly maaticate food. If the
food is not properly chewed the stomach has too.greata' burden placed upon ‘|
it, the digestion is imperfect, the.entire system becomes disarranged, and
the person becomes nervous, irritable, and dyspeptic.

But this is not all. - The ragged roots and the cavities in teeth harbor
putrefying food and germs which slowly but surely poison the body, causing®

Tonsillitis, Rheumatism, and Heart Disease.

About 5¢ per cent. of school children have defective teeth. If a child
bas an aching tooth, or a painful gumboil do you think it possible that he
can léarn his lessons or progress in school as he. should? Destructive
changes in teeth start in early lite, long before the child reaches an ago
where be can realize the value of good teeth. ‘

The responsibility for good teeth Is (bus placed upon the parent, So
the {ignorant or careless, parent is to blame for this 50 per cent. of children
who are hampered physically and mentally because of poor teeth.

Parents must learn the value of good teeth. If they have neglected
their own teetb or if their teeth have suffered from their parents neglect,
should they not try and do better by their own children? Let the parents*]
realize that a.few dollars paid to the dentist early.in life"will purchase for
their children the priceless jewels and ensure their children’s health,

Where parents fail in thelr duty to their children the municipality, the
school, the public health authorities; and the state should step in and
assume the responsibility! The children are our future citizens, and upon
their individual health and efficiency depends the welfare of the nation.

Why are the Grecksa degenerated from the intellectual, athletic, and
warlike nation of early history, to the miserable people of the present day? \
Disease such as malaria’is said by competent authority to be the cause.

At no former period in thé history of ¢he British nation was there
greater need of ensuring the mental and physical efficiency of our people.
Nothing is of greater importance in this regard than the care of Nature's
Jewels. :

School teachers, school medical inspectors, and schoo! nurses can and
do exercine an invaluable good in discovering defects in children’s teeth.
Schoo] dentists can do the rest.

The work of preserving chjldren’s teeth should be promoted as follows:

(1) Locate children with defective teeth,

(2) Notify careless and indifferent parents of existing
trouble.

(3) Provide dental attention for neglected children,

These lines are not directed so much torthe public health departments
of well-managed cities, but more particularly t@ the authorities of towns
and rural communities where knowledge of such matters may not be so well
disseminated.

Parent and teacher who réad.this column, will you do your duty?

The early care of the teeth is one of the greatest of public health problems.

Every child should be taught to use a tooth-brush in a proper manner.
The brush should; not be too stiff nor too large. The teeth should «he
brushed not across théjr.surfaces but up and down, go as to remove sub-
stances between the teeth. Any food particle that sticks between the teeth
and cannot be reached by the fibres of the brush, may be removed by a
th.eud of silk run between the teeth. The brush should be used at least
twice a day: on rising in the morning and on retiring at night. The
retention of bits of food between the teeth during the night is most injur-
jous to the teeth, The kind of tooth paste used does not matter. The
chief fault with pastes of all kinds is that they are altogether too expensive,
A little powdered borax is a cheap and simple substance to use for cleansing
the teeth. Do not allow tartar to accumulate on the teeth It not only
promotes decay but is apt, if neglected, to cause destruction of the teeth
from pyorrboea, By al) means see a first-class dentist about every six
months, It is chenper and better to prevent decay of the teeth than to curp
the results of neglect.
