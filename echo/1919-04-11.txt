“eeeeeeseceeeeoreeeeer" SPRING TONIC GREATLY =
| 7 INCREASES YOUR EFFICIENCY

£ Lay the Foundation of Good Health Now by Building Up Your

ps Blood and Strengthening Your Nerves.

The good old fashion of taking a tonic in the springtime, like
most of the customs of our- grandparents, is based upon sound
common sense and good medical practice. No matter how mild
the winter it is a trying time, even in the most favored climates, —
for those who are not in rugged physical health. Many men, *
| Yomen and children go through the winter on reserve. strength
fe | they have stored up during the sunny, summer months, and grow
$ increasingly pale as the spring days approach. A tonie for the
blood and nerves at this time will do much for such people, by
putting color in their cheeks and banishing that tired feeling

 
 

 

  

‘that worries thousands at this season of the year.

You cannot be energetic if your blood is thin and weak, or if
your nerves are frayed or shattered. You cannot conipete with
others if you do not get refreshing sleep at night, or if you are
losing, weight. You need a tonic at thisaime to add to your effi-
ciency now, as well as to save you from suffering later on. And
in all the realm of medicine there is no safer or better tonic than
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. These pills make new,
rich, red blood, which circulates through every portion of the
body, strengthening jaded nerves and. run-down organs, ‘and
bringing-a feeling of new strength and energy to weak, easily
tired, despondent men, women and children

Der Syndicate.)
“Jiggers, the boss!”
And upon the heels of the whis-
pered warning Mr. Joseph Q. Hattis-
bury, heavy-footed and always sober,
entered the sanctum of his private of-
fice.
The “Q,” it must be stated, had
been added to his name coincident
with his appointment to the vacant
presidency of the Consolidated Metals
eorporntion, marking a very gradual
rise from his lowly beginning as er
rand boy for this same business insti-
tution some 40 years back. There was
about as much logic to his belief that
the “Q,” which stood for nothing, add-
ed a unique dignity to his name, as for
bis idea, assimilated through the
course of his career, that heavy-footed
walking was an indication of a “dom-
{nant personality.” Of course, Mr. Jo-
seph Q. Hattisbury would not have
characterized it so, principally for
the renson that he seldom knew the
meaning of or how to spell words of
greater than monosyllabic length.
As the’ door, labeled in letters of
warning size “Private,” banged shut,
a small, thinnish fellow, with deep-set
eyes, looked up from the large sheet
oyer which he was.bent, and retriev-
{ng the lighted cigarette from his
pocket, whistled rellevedly, His thin-
ning hair and the telltale crow's feet
about the eyes seemed to vie oddly
with his boyish mannerisms,
“Tf {t hadn't been for your ‘jiggers,’
Helen, I'd "ve been caught that time
sure.”
Helen rested her hands, with their
network of blue-veined ridges, on the

no longer be called exactly young, but
an {ndefinable happy turn to her lips
reflected a wnever-absent sense of
humor. She was conservatively and
economically dressed in a dark serge
skirt which eloquently testified by {ts
sheen {ts fourth year of continuous
service, Black, Idw-heeled shoes and a
white lawn waist completed the bust-
nessiike severity of her costume, re-
lieved only by a small amethyst brooch
fastened to the throat.

“Right you are, Rodney,” she re-
plied, but her volee did not have its
usual buoyancy. The man noticed it.
“What's the matter, old scout?” he
asked consolingly, getting up from his
chair and proffering her a bag of cara-
mels. She refused the gonterton.
“Tired, Helen?”

“Yes, I am—tired to think that
you've got to hide a cigarette in your
pocket as if you were a little kid, and

ly to the door marked “Private,” “old-
maid teacher.”

Rodney smiled. “Let up on the old
maids, Helens You're living in a glasa
house all your own.”

“Oh, but I'm a woman and it makes
no difference if I push the keys of this
comptometer forever. But you're sup-
posed to be a man and make a name
for yourself fn this world. Does the
Prospect of smoking when {t pleases
the other fellow appeal to zon for the
rest of your life?” ~

Rodney stood silent. /This ‘wis &
new Helen.

“Look here, Helen, we've been work-
ing together now fer nearly ten years
right in this office, and you've never
talked this way before. You know I've
never dared risk starting something
for fear I'd fall. So I've been content
to put up with the old man.” a

“Well, you've got to take a chance
some time. Shame, ‘that for the se-
curity of three menis a day you've been
“content to lodge.in a rut! Don't fol-
low my example. Here I am wéll along
fn the thirties, and still letting this
thing think for me,” and she gave the
eomptometer n viclous shove. “You
get out, Rodney, and take a chance.
A man at forty is still young these
days.” +

Helen smiled at the unusnalness of
their conversation and her new rolo
of adviser. Sh6 couldn't help smil-
ing. op ; 4

“Well, Til tell you what,” he an-
swered, as he clapped his hands to-
gether to seal the bargain, “you sug-

examined,

A hot and seathing refusal was on
Helen's lips. Oht
cious arrogante! Was she nothing but

‘another step in his upward progress?

Did she have no choice? How long
had she been under consideration? Was
her position im jeopardy? The ques-
tions raced like flashes of Hghtning
through her confused mind. Then as
in a panorama there passed before her
the years of confining hours, the toil-
ing-days and the nights without recre-
ation—just work, work and more work
—that one might live. The very white
ness of her walst semed to implore
surcease from frequent washings and
the shiny serge skirt silently pleaded
honorable discharre from service.

And here was iiberation! Within her
grasp was materin! ense for the rest*
of her yerrs. Helen hesitated.

“May I have time to think It over,
Mr. Hattisbury?” she asked slowly.

He seemed puzzled as to what ne
cessitated consideration, “Yes,” he
finally answered, “you may have a
week.”

As Helen returned to her desk Rod-
ney looked up—and promptly done
again. Helen was crying.

In the next succeeding days she was
grateful that he did not question her,
But Rodney was preoccupied in his
own affairs.

It wns the afternoon of the fifth
day.

“Helen,” Rodney called abruptly as
he heard the last echoing footsteps of
their employer down the hall, “will you
marry me?”

Helen’s hand went to her forehend.
Two proposnis in one week for a
woman who had reached her thirty-
eighth birthday without any. Rodney
came over to her,

“Listen,sHelen. I've been thinking
a greatAleal about what you told me
er day—about making some-
of myself, You're right. I've
been {n a rut-”

Helen shoved her comptometer to one
side. This was a new Rodney.

“So I went and stuck the six hun-
dred I've snved up Jn the cutest little
dellentessen you over saw. It’s got
cans of stuff on the shelyes and cheeses
on the counter and cnkes In the case
and flour in the bin, and,” he ran on
excitedly without stopping for breath
as Helen grasped his cont sleeve in the
contagious enthusiasm, “there 1s a good
trade. It'll’ be slow plugging at first,
lot and lots of work, but—but it’s a-go.’

He leaned toward her with arms ex-
tended. “All It needs—all I need fs a
wife—that'll make everything com-
plete.”

Helen could not speak. Something
was choking her.

“Tll be good to you,” he pleaded,
taking her silence for a refusal.:“T'll do
all the work. Honest I will. I just
want you to’encourage me. Won't you
please? It means—oh,’ it means inde-
pendence!”

Rodney stopped. Helen was crying
—again. He sat down on her desk and
with one hand about her shoulder he

  

patted her head wih the other.
“Siggers, one YW” he called as the f
door opened. +

But théy weren't in time. “Mr, Joseph |

Q. Hattisbury had seen. He brought |

one. foot down after the other with a
ponderous thud:

“Miss Bently,” he snorted In high {n-
dignation, “after my talk, what. does
this mean? I cannot give you_a week
to decide. Choose now.” ) ~~

Helen stopped crying and looked
from Her opinionated employer to Rod-
ney*With his deep-set_eyes still plend-
Ing his cause. The one held promise
of comfort and of submission; the
other, work—and independencé.

“Oh, Tl take a chance,” she sald,
“I choose the delicatessen.”

“Home itie Within the Empiro” Is
Their Policy,

Althougii{t is, as yet, too early to
attempt ay forecast concerning the
Drospecta § the new Centre Party in
Ireland, titre {6 no doubt that the
Prime moy#s In the scheme can Jay
claim to the @nfidence of both sides,
Sir Horace Funkett is himself the
very personiffAtion of the via media,
The fairness did resource with which
he filled the yipremely difficult of-
fice of chairmap Of the Irish Conven-
tion, eighteen Honths ago, won cor-
dial recognitia). from all parties, No
Ulsterman felt 2nY reason to doubt:
hia regard fer (ster or his sympathy
with her posjtj0, and there was no
man ‘from (© South or West who
‘did ‘not feo] (hat he had in Sir Hor-
ace a tried plend, Then Capt. Ste-
phen Gwynn, the chairman of tho
new party, willst he sat in the Jast
Parliament a ® Nationalist, and was
widely known for his ardent advocacy
of Home Rule, has, by his signal
services at (he front, given pirooft
enough of his loyalty to the Empire
and the cause ef the Allles to, satisfy
even the moat exacting Ulsteippan.
As to Gen; Sir Hubert Gougin, five
years ago Ulster, would have ainimed
him unreservedly as her own.
Sir Hubert Gough who, on thait me-
morable day jf’ March, 1914, when
informed by sir Arthur Paget, com-
mander-in-chief in ireland, that his
brigade might be required for mctive
service in the northern prwvince,
sent in his resignation rather than
risk beiAg® obliged to take part in the
“coerciof of Ulster,”

In thos¢ days Sir Hubert Gough
had very strong and imperative
views; brit, between March, 1914,
and Febritary, 1919, lies the war,
and Sir Hubert has come back from
the war, where he saw Irishmen of
all creeds and political views fighting
side by siide in the trenches, with
that broader outlook which so many
men and women have gained in
France and on other battle fronts.
To-day. Sir Hubert {s a convinced
supporter of Home Rule, as he un-
derstands {it, and it is refreshing to
find how well he does understand it,
There js mothing vague about his
views, as jue unfolded them, reéently,
Ireland, ‘he insists, needs self-gov-
ernment to steady herself. Irishmen
abroad have shown. themselves emin-
ently capable in the art of govern-
ment, and, once;admitted to the man-
agement of their own affairs in Ire-
land, they will know how to deal
with extremists. Extre m will dis-
appear, he declares, because {it can-
not survive ‘the. practical tests.
Ulster, however, cannot be, and mist
not be coerced. Sir Hubert -is quite
as definite on this ppint as he was
{n.1914, and so he urges for Ireland
“sell-government, within the Empire,
on federal lines, subject to the Im-
perial Parliament in certain matters
whole Empire,” and
permitting local provincial self-gov-
ernment within her awn borders.”
This plan would, he considers, meet

  
 
 

the objections of Ulstef, and would,

avoid the evils of partition. With
partition, Indeed, as a solution of the
question, Sir Hubert Gough will have
nothing to do, Partition, he declares,
would result in an impenetrable wall
being built. between Ulster and the
rest of Ireland, a result the very
opposite of that aimed at'by the Cen-
tre Party.

Now as to the arguments for or
awcainst Sir Hubert.Gough's Views,
they niay be for the moment dis-
rejearded: They are sufficiently well
Indeed, {t is dimtult .to

Honte. Rule fér rleland ‘which has
not been adduced. .What renders Sir
Hubert Gough’s views. and the whole
intent of the Céntre Party “trémen-
dously important, at the. present
juncture, is that the desire for com-
promise which they” represent ‘is
clearly the only line along which go-
jution is in any way possible. There
is no solution in the wildly positive
attitude of Sinn Wein, just as there
8 no solution in the doggedly nega-
tive attitude of Ulster.

Of compromise, and it is the spirit’ of
Compromise-that pervades the policy
of the-Centre“Party* As Capt. Ste-
Phen Gwynn, its chairman, put it, re-
the new, party desires a con-
feren@, of Irishmen /as soon as

possible, q new Irish convention, For,

the Centre party recognizes two facts
clearly €Xough; first, that the Irish
question Cin only be settled as the
result of CUimpromise, und, second,
that the Iris) question is an Irish
question, 204 just be settled *

FOR WHAT HE WROTE
ABOUT FLORIDA CROPS

 

St. Petersburg Newspaper Declares
2 His Observations Were
Only Casual.

The Independent newspaper, pub-
ished at St. Petersburg, Fla., is dis-
pleased with certain statements made
by~Mayor Lewis Wigle, of Leaming-
tion, Ont., a recent visitor, in a letter
published jn the Amherstburg Echo.

In his letter Mr,. Wigle thus ex-
pressed “himself;

The Independwn, says that *Mr.
Wigle’s Observations are based upon

It continues:

more and © 8@i) only an

AMHERSTBURG BOARD

 

Regular Monthly Meeting Friday

Night of Much Interest.

 

The first regular monthly meeting
of the Amherstburg Board of Trave
was held in the Public Library audi-
torlum Friday night. While the at-
tendance was not large, there was no
lack of enthusiasm. nearly everyore
jn the gathering taking some part in
the discussion. *

President G. S. Rutherford occupied

  
  

the rx and before launching into
regular business, read the names of
the committees appointed by the

Board of Directors. as follows: —
Finanée—C, A. Quddy, Si. Bertrand,
J. X Auld, J. G. Mullen and Dr. W. F.
Park
Public. Improvement—F. A, Hough,
A. W. Marsh, H. M, Stancliif, Nev. H.

 

A, Wright and W._S, Falls...
Entertainment—F. W. Haas, G. H.
Jones. A. J. Burnside, I, H. -Deuike

and A, J. Burns,
Industrial—W. S. Wigle, J. 1. Love-
ove; W. W. Trimble, J. N. Mullen
and F. W, Haas.

Transportation—A. L. Campbell, H.
A. Forhan, ©. Wigle, F. J. Trotter and
R. Dorsey.

Mr. Rutherford dealt at some length
with the duties of each committee, pre-
facing his remarks with a general ex-
planation of. what the Board of
Tradé was expected to do for Am-
herstburg, the primary object being
to boost the town. “Nothing.” sald
he. “can be obtained without effort.
We cannot expéet Amherstburg to
prosper unless .we all get out ‘and
boost.” “We should adopt as our
slogan: “Buy your supplies in Am-
herstburg.” . But on the other -hand
the merchants of Amberstburg must
sell thelr goods as dheaply as they
can be .bought™im Windsor, and not
that price plus the car fare. Our
home merchants must also keep the
same quality of goods as can be
bought elsewhere. It hurts the town
to be charged more for an inferior
article.

A discussion followed in the qués-
tion of affilating with the Border
Chaniber of Commerce, and opinions
were expressed that it would “be bet-
ter to walt and affiliate with a county
organization if -one were effected.
was left to a committee
comprised of W. S, Falls, C. A. Cuddy
and F, A, Hough, which the Board
had appointed to look into the mat-
ter.

An aggressive membership com-
paign will be put on before the next
regular-meeting, which Is to be in the
form of a get-togethér banquet-to, be
arranged by the entertainment com-
mittee with the following: additional

of the canipaign for members and ar-
rangements for theentertainment and

in the ground; the handle was) shat-
tefed and the groand torn up for
some feet away, The crash was. ter-
rific andvhot only Mr. Quick's family

THIS WEEKIN THE LEGISLATURE

Several
before the fouse for discussion out-
‘| side of the jsual routine during the
past week, ‘There was a motion
| brought in by Wm. MeDonald, of N,
'| Bruce, second?d by Mr. Carter, of
Guelph, asserting that the representa-
tion in the Ontario Legislature {8 too
large, unwieldly and expensive, and
pointing to the huge #um of $160,000
for-indemnity and expenses paid to
members during the past year. Mr.
McDonald desired a reduction in the
number of constituencies to conform
with the representation from Ontario
in the Federal House, namely from
111 to $9. After a_mirthful discus-
sion Mr.-McDonald withdrew his mo-
tion, He was supported in it by Mr.
Proudfoot, the Opposition leader, who
thought the motion should have been
recefved more serfously. If the mem-
bership was reduced -to 89 it would
save the Province $40,000 a year and
on that account {t might have been
advisable to consider a reduction.
Sam Carter belleved that the founda-
tlon of representaion should be popu-
lation. The motion, however, was
generally opposed. ~*
A remarkable vote took place upon
a discussifon of the motion placed up-
on the Orner Paper by Mr. Hartley

h"Dewart; of S. W. Tofonto, in connec-

tion with the women’s dregs, at -the
opening of the Legislature.
Government moyed aN amendment to
Mr. Dewart's motion (which. by the
way, was entirely ifrrevelant), sub-
stituting congratulations tothe wo-
men of the Province for their splen-
did services in the War, and to this
was added a fuxther amendment. by
Mark Irish, of Toronto. to the effect
that the House recognized the great
service of the women in the-produc-
tion of » munitions..« The Liberals
were not to be caught voting against
these amendments “and therefore the
motion aS’ amended was carried
unanimously amid d great deal of
laughter.
War Tax Abolished.

The Provincial Treasurer introduced
# resolution to abolish the Provinvial
War Pax, which was agreed to and
referred to the Committee of tlhe
Whole House in connection with 4
bill to repeal the Provincial War Tax
Act.

Cost of Hamilton Highway.

Th reply to a question from the Lib-
eral side as to the total cost of the
Toronto and Hamilton Highway,
whether it’ had been completed, and
if-not what additional it would cost
to complete it, the Minister of Public
Works stated that wp to, January 21st
an expenditure had been made on con-
struction of $1,088.017.71 exclusiva of
thé extra cost of widening roadways,
storm-sewers, etc.. to be paid by the
radial. railway amd local municipall
tles. The road has not vet been
completed and an additional cust will
bei an estimated) charge upon the
Commission of $18,300, which doa;
not include the Hamilton entrance,
radial railway track moving, or Com:
missioner’s share of bridge. construc:
tion, which items have to he adjusted
by the Ontario Railway and Municipal
Board.

been made by the Goverment _as to

tario Tempé@rance Act next fall, but

(1) The repeal of the On-

Tt is expect¢ithal the Government

the House during the coming week.
\ “Assessment Law Change... ;
As a°result of the findings 6f the
Bpécial committee appointed to .con-
sider the Assessment Act and the pro-
fposed amendments thereto, a report
