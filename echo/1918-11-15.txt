How Many Crowns for

Your’ Honor Flas?

 

Of course every city, town and district
will earn its Honor Flag

; But how about the crowns?

For every twenty-five . per cent. in
excess of its quota, each. city, town and
district will be entitled to add a crown to
its flag.

Can you do fifty per cent. better than

your quota—that means two crowns for

your Honor Flag.

But double your-quota and it means
four crowns. .

Hang a Flag in your hall, that for
years to come will show that. your city,
town or district did better than well— —

That it was a real factor in the huge

THE PRODUCTICN AND
APPLICATIGN OF ANTI- ©
HOG MOLERA SERUM
(Frank Hawkts. Pitman-Moore
Co, rvice Jepartment.)

Hog cliolera {js ti¢ commonest and
most highly, contajious disease that
Affects swine, No bredof hogs is im-
mune to jt. The death rate from this
disease fs so great that { constitutes
one of the most serious Sources of
losses Affecting the agricytural indus-
try of the United States

Causes.—Hog choléra jy wiused by
the presence in the blood of & Virus
or poison, the exact nature of Which
as never been determined, ag mience
las not yet succeeded in separating
this virus from the other elements !9
the blood. This virus:cannot be gi@0
by the microscope, and the elements
of which it Is composed are so infin
itesimally small that they pass freely
rough the finest filter.

This. Miterable virus ts found not
only In the blood of every hog that ts

ted with cholera, but in the
fmcos, the urine, and ‘he arly all the
body Ussues

The only way in an animé!

in contract hog cliolera Is by actui!
contact with this virus le.many bP
Hefs tut the disease ig caused by suc!

conditions may bring about lessened
resintancé to the disease, but a genu-
Ine case of hog cholera can occur @nly
after the hog has come in contact with
the cholera virus, and has taken seme
of the virus {nto its own system.

How the Disease Spreads —Hog
cholera may be transmitted {on a fum-
ber of ways; by direct contact of one
Agnal with inathor;-in-s ping gir

or feeding troughs; by birds, by
Streams, by dogs and parawites; -on
he shoee of ind{vidualsy and byeating
infected food. It fs most’ frequently
contracted at the time.of feeding, and
herds that are confined in close, ill-
nthated or unsanitary quarters are
st readily infected, and tuey offei

Istance to its ravages

dead of the @isease aftenm curry
the causative agent to remote fields,
Where they communicate it to healthy
animals 2 pollution of a stream
caused by the presence of an {nfected
carcass, May carty the infection to |
other herds miles away. Hogs shipped |
by rall, frequently loaded from infect-
ed yards into clean cars or {nto cars

plague from stock-yard to stocy rd. |

Practically all public stock-yurds are |
infectedt with cholera. as are all pub-
lic feeding pens and rest stations pro-
Wded by common carriers for the ac-
commodation of hogs in- transit

)There is always » probability of in-
faction at public fairs and stock
shows, and none but immune animals
shouldbe sent to such places for-ex
hibition purposes. Alter. returning
from an., exhibition such. animals
showd be quarantined for at east
thirty days Hefore being permitted. to
Mingle with the herd -

So, here mgain. we find the absolute
importance of” keeping in the’ most

quarters which our hogs occupy.
use of coaltar disinfectants or un
slaked line, plentif{ully scattared over
the feed lot, under the ‘troughs, and in
the sleeping quarters,, helps in
stroying the infection.”

The Application of the Scrum Treat-
ment.—Antl-hog chelora serum
heen proven to be Of great value
controlling

in
outbreaks ‘of the disease

und in preventing loases of swine as”n |

result of liog cholera. There are two
methods of employing the* treatment:
known as the serum aloneyor “single”
method, and the simultafeous or
“double” method. Each of these
methods *has¥its advantages © and
disadvantages, The serum alone
method possesses the advantage of
being absolutely safe, in that it cannot
by any possibility cause spread of the
disease, and does not require any ex

traordinary care of the animals after |

treatment. [ts disadvantage lies In,
the’ fact that the immunity produced
by. this method is of only short dur-
ation; usually ‘lasting for from three
to aix weeks, after, which time the
treated mal may become as sus-
ceptible to cholera infection as before
The advantage of the simultaneous
dreatment [8 that when properly ad-
rministered it produces immunity of
very much longer duration, The sim-
ultaneous treatment consists of the
injection of a small quantity of hog
choJera virts in» qddition “to the
serum. Tho purpose’ of using the
virus is to produce a reaction in the
éyatom.of the animal, which under
proper conditions will render it per-
tmanently immune to ‘cholera. afford-
ing. Ufelong protection to the immun-
ized animal when administered to
swine of sufficient age and weight. lt
must be borne in mind, hovvever, that
hog cholera virus may well be Ifk-
ened to fire; a most valuable thing
when kept under proper control and
easily controiled as long as it is keot
in its proper place and handled with
due precautions for saféty; but a
most dangerous and destructive agent
when allowed to escape from the con
trol of Its mastor. ,
The administration of the simultane-
ous treatment should pot be unJer-
taken except by competent vaterin-
arians, who have had special trainizsur
in this particular line. Theve opor-
ators must understand how to eorrnet-
ly ‘gauge the dosage” of serum and
virus for different Animals; oud their
Judgment on this point mus: be based
on the physical condition of each {p-
dividual. animal, and the conditioii«
under which the herd is kept, aa woli
4is on the size and weight of the ani-
mals that are treated. They must
understand how to prevent the edcape
of any of the virus, and how to do-
stroy its dangers by carefal disinfect-
tion, shoul& any virus be accidentally
spilled or escape from needle wounds
in the treated anima). They must be
able to give the hog owners full and
definite instructions about feeding
and caring for thelr hogs before and’
aftor treatment, and it fs the owror’s
duty to himself and his herd to ob
serve such instructions carefully, All
of these things are uecesstry parts
|of successful immnisation, tue hey
aro not difficult to secure when tho
work is placed in competent hands.

The Victory Loan and the
Farm go together,

Canada's surplus farm pro

the Victory Loan.

_ If the ‘suipios could not be
sold, prices in the home market
would go to picces, >

It is one thing to raise farm
products, but it is another thing
to sell them for cash.

A large proportion of Cana
dian farm products could not be

You are a farmer.

Canada is a farming country.

Canada grows more food than the
people of Canada need.

To prosper she must sell that sur-

plus food.
Great Britain is owr best customer

for grain, pork, beef, cheese and other he

farm products.

Every practical man must see how
important it is to hold the British trade.
Canada wants not only the profit on
this trade, she wishes to create a good-

-will in Britain. towards Canadian_pro-
ducts and thus assure our export busi-
ness for the future. °

At the moment Great Britain asks

for credit, asks Canada to sell her the

roducts of the farm, “on time.” To
*shold her trade, it is#recessary'to give

this credit.

 

This takes capital—immense capital. E

For Britain’s purchases from Canada

are huge, and these purchases must be
paid for in cash. :

In these times, it is not easy even
for a nation as wealthy as Canada*to
procure money. Certainly, no other
country can lend us money. The only
way now open for Canada to secure

Vi -motiey is to borrow from the peaple of
fi Canada.

As a matter of business; what
do you think of the plan?

This is the reason for selling Victory

Bonds.

Can anyone deny the-sound business
sense of this plan of protecting our
valuable market P

From the standpoint of the man
what better security could
et for his money? Where else

could he get a five and a half per cent.
returnon such security? Where would

he find an investment to pay interest
so regularly and with so little trouble
to the lender? Certainly Canadians
have an opportunity to benefit very
directly from this borrowing plan.
And the money. Ganada_ borrows is

spent entirely in Cahada—a very large

part of it for the very crops the farmer
has to sell.

Therefore, af the Victorye-Lggnis g.=.-

Avoid Price Extremes in Buying Shoes.

on The measure of econonry in buying Shoes is the service you get per dollar of expenditure. It is waste to buy
shoes which were made to sell at a very low price, and it is equally unwise to pay extremely high prices. Beyond a
certain point it is not possible to increase the practical value of a shoe and when you.pay more than a fair average
price you are: probably paying for “frills.” So we say to you: Keep in the miiddie of the road. Don’t pay tess than 36 for
a pair of shoes to-day and expect to get good vlue. On the other hand, don’t think it is necessary to pay more than $S
at the outside. You probably can judge values for yourself if you will for service rather than appearance merely, and
if you will be guided by the dealer's knowledge and experience. A quicker and easier way, however, is to look for the
manufacturer's trade mark on the shoes you buy. It is the best guarantee of good values, for the manufacturer's busi-

ness reputation is behind it.
