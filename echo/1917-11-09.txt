LONIG MARSH DRAINAGE DECISION

/Towmships of Anderdon and Colches-
ter South ~<
vs.

Towfship of Malden.

These were -appeals by the Town-
ships of Anderdon and} Colchester
Smuth against. a Supplemental Re-
POrt on the Long Marsh drain in. An-
derdon and Malden, made’ by Alexan-
der Baird, O.1.8., dated August 24th,
1916, which was soryed by Malden on
the appeall <ownships for the pur-
Pose of & womMe $23,936.00, in

the orfginal. cost of the
work, Whiich was $31,925.00. The work

88 completed cost in all $56,861.00 and
the dispute was as to the excess coat.

The appeliiant claimed™that .the reeve:

gnd council of Malden had acted. il-
legally ound improperly, and waste
fully and extravagantly in letting’ the
cor4racts both for” excavation and

, ‘he excavation was estim-

~ £684 to cost $23,292, but actully cost

$37,700. Bridges whitch were estim-
ated to-cost $4,000.00 cost $10,400.00.
The reeve of Malden in 1912, Robert
Atkin, had taken the mattor of letting
the contracts out of the hands of Mr.
Baird, O.L.8., who was appointed

by-law of Malden, ai engineer w!

power to let the ‘contracts for the’
work. J. J. Dewhirst, the ex-reeve of
Rochester, who témdered on the work
at $23,000.00, waa told by the reeve,
if he raised his tender $200.00 he could
get thecontract. The contract was:
drawn~up for that purpose with the

additional amount included. Dewhirst | 9!”

DIRECTIONS FOR
MAKING THE TRENCH
OR LIBERTY CANDLES

in view of the great interest
locally in the above subject, The
Echo publishes directions. Rev.
Fr. Ryan, Parish Priest, has do-
nated a barrel of broken and
ends of parrafine candles for the
purpose and town ladies are pre-
paring great quantities of
“trench candles” for sending
abroad.

Cut newspapers through the
fold lengthwise, fold again and
cut crosswise. This will give
sheets ahout 18 Inches-long and
12 inches wide, varying slightly
according to size of the papers
used,

Spread ten of these sheets
and begin rolling at the short
edge over a small tound stick
such as a lead pencil, large”
knitting needle or flag stick—
anything that will leave a small
hole in the cylinder of paper.
This 15 necessary, to insure draft
for the candle,to burn.

Roll very tighitly for about 3
Inches, then fold back 3 sheets
toward the rolled part and con-
tinue to wrap around the roll
almost to the first fold. Then
fold back another three sheets
and continue to wrap and fold
to the margin of the paper when
there should be butone sheet.
Gine or paste.this sheet to. the
roll.

If the 9 sheets are nop turned
under as the wrapping-progress-
es, there will be too many edges
to glue.

With@a very sharp knife cut
Into 32-inch lengths and boil in
paroffine for 10 minutes...

A personal touch niny be add-
ed. by writing in’ red ink on
white paper the name atid ad-
dress of donor;and any cheery
message. Pasté uround the
candle before dropping into the
paraffiine.

HOLD SCALES FAIRLY.

That they dre dfvilians appearing
to represent the Government to
watch the claims of civilians before
a tribunal that is civilian and not
military was the keynote of instruc-
tions given last week to the military
representatives of the Toronto Milli
tary District, who assembled in con-
ference at the Mining Bullding. Gen.
Logie, Col. R. H. Greer and the On-
tario Registrar, Glyn Osler, address-
ed the meeting, pointing out tho var-
fous phases of the Act, and elucidat-
Ing hitherto mysterious clauses and
regulations that are to govern the
representatives in their work. “Hold
the scales absolutely fairly,” sald
Gen. Logie, “and let your keynote be
absolute fuirness and justice to in-
dividual and industry. Your duty is
to watch exemptions and see that
there is even-handed justice in carry-
ing out the spirit of the Act.”

PATRIOTIC MODES.

What War Has Done to Mod-

The government needs all the dark
blue and ollve drab/woolen material it
can gather together, an therefore it
gtands to reason that women shouldn't
try to make these colors fashionable at
the present moment, There seems no
immediate prospect of their doing so,
The smarteat color today is brown in
every poisible shade qnd tone.

Woman's patriotism may have some-
thing to do, with her increasing inde-
pendence in the matter of clothes. She
no Jonger submits to a complete change
in cut and line every six months, - It is
a fact undeniable that she has demand.
ed plainer and ‘more comfortable
clothes—not that Paris has told her to
wear this sort; wot that the war bas
put the pall of somberness upon her
soul, Her clothes are:not somber, nor
sad, nor plain, They are almply sensi.
ble, and that they will be from now
on—or the signs of the times are to be
distrusted. Thig. does not mean, as
some, cynics would huve you believe,
that woman's clothes will not be beav-
dful. I¢ means tliat she refuses ab-
solutely to be a party to any fregk-
{stiness delibernteily planned by some
femote person wiith an eye only to his
own bank accoumt.

BEAUTY HINTS.

How to Take Care of Your Complexion
After Motoring. =

Either hot or cold water applied to
the complexion directly after a long
automobile ride may do harm to the
skin. And water need not be expected
to take out the grime that hours of
facing wind and dust have driven ‘into
the pores. A vigorous scrubbing at the
journey’s end will only make the flesh
stiff and shiny and leave a painful.
burning sensation for hours thereafter.

Defer the hot. water bath for an hour
and apply.. when. you. come in from
your ride.'some good cold. cream, plas-
tering it thickly over the face, ardund
the ears and on the neck, Then rub it
of with a soft cloth and powder lightly

MAY HAVE FUEL DEPOT.

Ontario Railway Board Approved By-
Law of Town of Forest.

The Ontario Railway Board made an
order last week approving of the by-
law of the town of Forest to establish
a fuel depot in that town.

Mr, Wallace, counsel for the town,
Stated’ that there were only two men
theré who handled coal, and that
was only a part of their regular busl-
ness, They could handle but a limit-
ed supply, and Forest, with a popula-
tion of 1,600, needed something like
16,000 to 20,000 tons of conl a year.
The town does not intend to interfere
with the business of these two men
if they can supply all the coal needed.
but they, want to be prepared’ to, sup-
ply coal should these mén fall down.
The coal will be sold on a cash basis,
and the by-law asked for the issue of
debentures for $1,500,

Sir Wilfrid Laurier has issued his *
manfesto. In a document addressed
“To the: Canadian People,” the Oppo-
sition leader déclares his policy and

: outlines “his aims: :

On the all-important question of
participation In the war, Sir: Wilfrid
claims. that “a fundamental . objec-:
tion to-the Government's policy of
‘conseriptton is~ thet it conscripts
‘human life only and does not attempt
to’ conscript wealth, resources, or
the services of any person other than

-|those who come within the age limit

prescribed by the Military Service
Act. ‘ ;

““The first duty of a Laurier ad-
iministration,”” scys ‘the manifesto,
“vould, be to find the men, money
and resources necessary to insure:
tho fullest measure of sipport to

POTATO STARCH.

Jet How'to Make It From Unmarket-
able Spuds.

Bruised and otherwise unmarketable
potatoes may be used in making potato
starch, a yery desirable and healthful
1ood. ‘

Potato starch can be used in many
ways for food purpose—in making sal-
nds, puddings, milk dishes, ete, ~ In
every potato section of the country
thousands of bustéls of potatoes are
wasted every year which could just as
well be utilized in making potato
starch. oon
Use plenty of water and a vegetable
scrubbing brush in washing the pota-
iges. Sent yourself in a convenient po-
fition with a vessel eontalning potatoes
ut one side and an empty vessel for the
gratings on the other, Place a digb-
pan with gratér on a low table and,
without removing the skins, grate your
potatoes by hand or run them through
the sausage grinder, Empty gratings
into Second tub or véssel. r
Over the gratings pour clean water.
Stir well! so as to saturaté every par-
ficle of the potatoes. Allow 40 stand
for a little time and then remove the
peelings and other floating. material
from the top of the water. Stir again,
udd a little. more clear water and allow
the same to stand for several hours or
overnight... The starch” granules will
settle to the bottom. and all pulp and
potato skins will rise to the top of the
| water or settle on top of the starch
granules, Remove the water carefully,
also the pulp and skins. Scrape the
‘dark coatgpff the top of the starch for-
mation, being carefol not to remove
any of the stareh.

A second time pour fresh clean water
over the starch. Stir thoroughly. Al-
low to.stand for several hours or over-

fight. Remove water and pulp as be-

fore and add another application of
water, Continue this as often as nec-
essary to render your starch perfectly
white and free, not only from the pulp,
but from all sand or sediment of any
kind which is not pure starch.

This operation can be abbreviated by.
rinsing the first time and then strain-
ing tho pulp, starch and water through
cheesecloth or cloth of finer mesb.—

To this Sir Wilfrid adds:

“As to the present Military Service
Act, my policy,will be not to proceed.
further under its provisions unt{l the
people’ haye an opportunity to pro-
nounce on it by way of a -referen-
dum. I pledge myself forthwith to
submit to the people, and with my
followers to carry out the wishes of
the majority of the nation as thus
expressed.” . >

As remedies for an economic aitua-
tion “which is admittedly critical,”
Sir Wilfr!d Laurier promises: —Tar-
{ff ‘reform, control of food supplies ~
and prices, and* a stop to profiteer-

Ing.”

Remove Excess Tariff,

Tie two increases to the tariff
mude since the beginning of thé war,
he would remove, These are 74-per
cent..on all commodities coming info
Cnnada from outside Great Britain,
and 5 per cent. on goods coming
from Great Britain . He also would
temove the duties on agricultural {m-
plements and other essentials as de-
manded by the western farmers.”

In connection with the high cost of
living, h@_would “take drastic steps
to bring under Government control
all food-producing factories, «so* that
food may be sold at a fixed: priee »
under the control of the Govern-
ment.” If satisfactory arrangements ,
could not be made with the foods
producing factories, Sir Wilfrid de-
clares*he would not hesftate to com-»
mandeer, 3

The manifesto . proeeeds:

End to Profiteering;

“One of ‘the most important con-
tributions towards winning the war
is to. put a stop to profiteering on
war supplies. The Government has
deliberately” encouraged profiteering
for the benefit of its partisan follow- ~
ers, A first duty of my administra-
tion would be to>insure to the coun->
try which pays for war ‘supplies; the
excess of exorbitant profits being
belig® realized by profiteers.” ~ If
necessary, Sir Wilfrid cont{nués, he
would not hesitate to take control
of the factories engaged: in the: man-
ufacture ‘of war materials... Suitable
Government, shops4also, Sir Wilfrid
believes, sltould be- ‘turned to the.
production of war materlals at cost
prices. ? 2

Reopen C. N. R. Case.

Sir Wilfrid passes in review alike
some of the legislation of the late
Government and the program of the
present. He finds mo trace in/ the
manifesto of the Unoiln Government
that its Liberal members haye in-
fluénced thelr colleagues to the adop-
tion of measures they deemed essen-
tial... He refers to “mast of the art-
icles” in that * manifesto ag’ “stale
commonplaces + - resunrected
for °a new ‘lection.” He—detlares
of the war-time election act passed
last ‘Séssion that “it is a blot upon
avery instinct of justice,” and*halds
the view that the Canadian Northern
Railroad purchase should be adjudi-
cated upon by the new parliament.

charged with the duty of preparing the
yoters’ list, which will not be printed.

Yn Ontario they will, take, as the
basis for thefr work, the last lists
prepared under the provincial ..law,
which was superseded by the Act of
this last aessiom of the Legislature.
From those lists the enumerators will
delete the names of persons disquall-
fied from voting by the new Dominion
Election Act, namely, persons of
enemy alien birth, naturalized since
March 21st, 1902, and “conscientious
objectors.” They will add to the tate
| female relatives of soldiers who have
gone overseas and other persons
qualified to vote. The enumerators
may secure the information they re-
quire by visiting the homes or work-
ing places of the electors or otherwise
at the) rdiscretion, They are to com-
plete their task 16 days before. poll-

daily for ten days before the polling-
day, to revise the lists, which they
will deliver to the deputy-returning-

enumerators will sit to hear spplica-
tions of persons not already on the
list to be put on. /

In cities and towns of 9,000 popula-
tion and wpwards enumerators are re-
quired to complete their_work 16 daya
before polling day. They will have
nothing to do with the revision of
Mats. :

Instead the work of revision will be
done by the “saters’ rogintration
boards,” establishéd by the Ontario
Franchise Act of 1917, and -constl-
tuted “boards of hppeal” for Dominion
purposes.

For the purpose of allocation of
votes cast by soldiera oversess, for

it was a wise old wit who remarked
thot if talk abont our aches and pains
Were suppressed a thin of the conver.
sation of civilized life would ceane, If
to this interdicted subject were added
that of unsatisfactory weather another
third would be chopped off.

It is amazing to hear humanity de-
voting #0 much of the brief time aliot-
ted us here to painfully detaiied ding-
noses of our headaches, backaches,
stomach aches-and innumerable other
miseries,

The comical part of {t Hes in the so!-
emn patience with which each listens
to the other. He or she knows, how-
ever, that his or her turn comes next,
and the luxury of anloading sickening
accounts of sickness will be indulged.

Many of us are not miserable enough
with the pains of the present, but must
treastre up the pains of the past as
constantly accumulating reservoirs of
misery and borrow them of the future
as a debt under which to groan and
grumble.

If we could forget {t all and permit
others to forget it, throwing open our
spiritual side to the boundless “bless-
ings offered it, what a universe of joy
and cheer and brightnéss before un-

FORGED ANTIQUES.

Even British Museum Experts Have
Been Fooled by Them.

The “antiquity” manvfacturer is a
man who thrives on expert forgery.
Furnittire, prints, china, pictures, plate,
tapestry—he imitates them all most
successfully, Each man has his spe-
cialty. One devotes himself to old
leather jacks,’ another produces horn
books, a third turns out “medieval”

Palissy plate for $250, While an at-

On other occasions terra cotta fig-
ures of Isis and Osiris, bought by the
institution for hundreds of pounds,
have been discovered to be composed
of modern clay. i aan

A good story is told of a forged ail-

and the effects on ,thé laboring man's

30,000 examinations in sixteen months
of 17,000 Americans and 13,000 foreign-
ors and found 96 per cent in need of
dental service. “In 30,000. mouths,”
the dentist said. “we find 60,000 cavi-

c Digestibility of Cheese.

By experiments on the digestibility
of cheese it hus boen shown that much,
depends on the special physical char-
acters of the fool. All fat cheeses are
said to be dissolved and digested with
gteat rapidity, because the molecules
of cascin—the nitrogenous part of the

| cheese—are separated only by the faty

and so the gastric juice can attack a
jarge surface of the cheese at one time.”
Whether the cheese bo lmrd or soft
does not appeur to influtnce digestion,
and there is no connection between the
digestibility and the percentage ‘of wa-
ter present in the cheese. . ,

A WESTERNER’S RECOMMENDATION.

By H, Milton Martin,

Ihave no hesitation in recommending to every one that at
leaat a portion of his funds be used for the purchase of CAN-
ADA VICTORY WAR LOAN BONDS, Whether {t be $650.00,
$109.00, $1000.00, or more that one has jn hand, there is no better
way, in my opinion, of, using this money than ¢o purchase VIC-
TORY BONDS. s

Now is the time for all women and’men who are dependent
upon their savings for-their liveliiood to loan them -+to Canada-
und ot the same time help themselves. Many of these have been
unable to assiat the various patriotic “organizations Because of
their limited income. Now they may INCREASE their income
and help Canada. It {8 not often that.one can personally benofit
by a patriotic act and surely now that tne occasion presenta it-
self, no one should fail to take adVantage of it. .

The objective set by the Minister of Finance ip $150,000,000.
Many guesses are being made fis to how much more will be sub-
scribed. Let every one help, whether it be for bonds of amall

denomination or large ones. Let every one who has the power,
purchase at deadt a $50.00 bond and thereby assist in continulag
the unobstructed use of the liigh seas, so that the products of
our farms, mines and fattories. may bo carried to our boys at
the front; 60 thant the farmers may be paid (or thelr grain; wo"
that every man employ piay receive his wages; so that Canada
may be maintained In the high esteem of si-the Allies.

Let us show what we think of our democratic inatitutions
by buying our own bonds, and Inst bat not least, Iot us show the
enemy that were in this war heart and soul and will be so untth
