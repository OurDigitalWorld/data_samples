FALL WHEAT SEASON
THE BEST IN YEARS

Even the Very Late Sown Fields are
Making Good Promise.

CROP FOR ONTARIO

— 2

THE

Average Yield.of Fall Wheat Exceeds
That of Spring Sown.

The splendid regults obtained from
sowing Spring wheat in Ontario this
year served wonderfully in the crisis
which arose fromthe very general
failure of Fall. wheat in the province,
nnd it js only reasonable to expect
that the very good yields obtained
from that crop’ will live the result
of still further increasing the acre-
age sown, next spring, In fact, many
farmers have withhold from sowing
their usual acreage of wheat this fall,
largely on account of the superior re-
sults from the Spring variety during
the past season, Futhermore, the
growing of a Fall wheat has proved
a disappointing business for two years
in succession, owing to unfavorable
weather conditions at sowing time 6r
else to the loss. caused by excessive
winter killing, To further discourage
the habitual Fall wheat grower, this

yeur's seeding-time was anything but

ideal for the getting in_of.n fair-sized
acreage, and most of the sowing was
done. either a Tittle on the early side
or much too late to guit.the ideas of
the most experienced. Now, however,

well on In. Noyember, when as a rule}?

the growth of Fall wheat ts beginning
to, slow up on account of cold weath-
er, the crop 1s going ahead by leaps
and bounds, and growers who~fcared
that they ha@sown very much .on.tho
late alde are beginning to take heart
for. the chances of their. crop and to
regret that they were unable to take
fhe grain drill over a wider area.
Others who passed ap wontever chance
they had to sow Fall wheat in o
to reserve the acréage for Spring
grain; aré beginning to regret their’
omission. - - 2

On the strength of paws records of
yleld of Fall whéat and Spring whent
In tho province, it seems hardly advis-
able to desert the former entirely in
favor of the latter merely because of|
the unusual performance of.

instructed that they are to no longer

largely caused through ‘water stand-

before
To Cure Black Knot Disease, .

No other cause, not even winter-
killing, has destroyed and {s destroy-
ing so many cherry and plum treca
in this province as the Black Knot
disease, This statement, while true
of the province as a whole, is not
true of the Niagara District nor of
any other district where plum and
cherry trees are carefully pruned and

Sprayed each year,

The disease is not caused by grubs,.
although these are often found in
the knots, but it is caused by a fun-
sSusswhich attacks the branches and
even the trunks of the trees and
causes black, knot-like swellings,
usually about three inches long and
about half an inch in thickness,
though often the swellings are much
shorter and often again very much
longer, the longest ones usually be-
ing found on the larger branches.
New knots at first are brownish in-
stead of black, the blackness coming
with age. ‘ 2

The disease will in some orchards
confine itself to cherry trees and not
attack the plums. In other cases it
will attack plums and not the cher-
ries, but more, commonly both are
attacked. . Z

Control] Measures.—In order to
control Black Knot thoroughly it is
helpful to know that it is spread by
means of tiny spores which act as
seeds, and are blown by the wind
from tree to tree. These spores are
formed“ on the knots themselves,
There are two main crops of them
each year, tho first during early
spring, usually in March and Aprjl,

the latter part of May and all of
June, Therefore, to control the dis-
ease the first step to také is to cut
down all dead and ‘dying trees and
remoye all knots on other trees, cut-
ting in each case about four inches
below the knot s0.a8 to be sure the
infected area is removed. If knots
occur on the very large branches or
on the trunk, they mily be removed
by means of a’chisel or a Very stout.
knife and chisel. An-inch at least
of the bark on cach side should, if
possible, be taken with the knots, All |!
prunings, whethér of dead or living
wood, should’ be burned at once,
otherwise the spores will form on
them ahd spread from them. *It is
very important to do this cutting out
and pruning before Christmas timo,
Warm days after the leaves are off”
are excellent for the purpose. Under
no conditions must the knots be left

Cassandra Andrews had done every-
thing she could think of. She had worn
her most becoming blouses\ and her
mst stockings—she had spant hours
doling her halr and brushing} her eye-
brows and-pellshing her nails, but a
whole school year had almost disposed
of itself and the young professor of
English Nternture had never seemed to
notice her at all, Before and after
class he joked and jaljied with other
rirls. The vivacious Roberta Stevens
nearly always stopped at hig desk for
a moment of chatter—Bertha Marvin,
the class beauty, the athletic Agnes
Burns and a dozen others were op the
friendllest_ terms: with him, but C@s-
sandra Andrews alipped.demurelly into

ently unnoticed.

“They're all crazy atbout-him,” she
thouglit scornfully, ag she watched the
professor's reception before class one
morning. “Every single one of them!”

‘After the professor had delivered his
lecture that morning, fhere was a gen-
eral discussion and he called on her

forward impetuously andi/fiatly contra-
dicted his comment. ‘Then ‘she fol-
lowed up the contradiction with a tum-
ble of words in support of ther own
opinion and sat speedily down mgain.

The professor was surprised: ‘“Well,”
he sald, crisply. “I'm glad tthat at

for herself. ,I was afrald you! were all

them “Christian names,” because they
nren't Christian, very often. “Given

heard of the Irishman assigting at 0

tion as to the child's name, broke
forth: “For the love, of hiven! the

THE CATTLE SITUATION.

 

Normal Prices Will Probably Not. Be

Farmers are ‘Urged to Market Their
Grain Through Live Stock.

 

The Toronto Live Stock Exchange,
composed of members exclusively in-
terested in the buying and selling of
Live Stock, wish to sét before the pro-
ducers of Live Stock the following
facts:— é

(1) The close of the war, instead of
diminishing? will greatly {ncrease’the
demand for food, and particularly for
meat. It is already evident that the
chief reason for the capitulation of
the Central Powers was that they had
not food to go along with, :

(2) The products: of the Canadian
farms are cereals and food animals.
At the present time. the demand far
both {s unlimited. The first demand
to be"satisfied will,,unquestionably, be
that for cereals. , All the world can
immediately set itself to the raising
of cereals. One crop will greatly
ameliorate the famine; two crops will
probably restore wheat reserves to
normal. *

In regard to live stock this 1s not
the case. The bullding up of cattle
herds, particularly, involves a pro-
gram of years, Even if the foundation
stock and the fodder were immediately
available in Europe, the Cattle herds

When Canada entered the war on

and an active militia of 60,000. When
hostilities ceased on the 11th of No-

seas 418,980 soldiers. .

At first Canada supplied a division:
This was increased until by 1916 she
had jn France an army corps of “four
divisions; a cavalry brigade, and
numerous other services, such as line

Avoid Price Extremes in Buying Shoes.

. © The measure of economy in buying Shoes is the service’you’get per dollar of expenditure. it is waste to buy
shoes which were m mate to sell at a very low price, and it is equally unwise to pay extremely high prices. Beyond 3
certain point it is not possible to increase the practical value of a shoe and when you pay more than a fair.averag>
price you are probably paying for * ‘frills. So we say to you: Keep in the middle of the road... Don’t nay less than $5 for
a pair of shoes to-day and.expect to get good v aluc. On the other hand, don't think it is necessary to pay more than $3
at the outside. You probably can judge values foc yourself if you wil) for service rather than appearance nicrely, and
if you will be guided by the dealer’s knowledge and experience. A quicker and easier way, however, is to look for ths
manufacturer's trade mark on the shoes you buy It is the best guarantee of good values, for the manufacturer's busi-

ness reputation is behind it.
