RIVER FRONT ROAD IN IT,

 

Approved by | Highways \ Department

At last the agitation that lias been
(ollowed up over @ period of years, to
have the front road between Ojibway
and Amherstburg, placed in :ue Coun-
ty schéme of Good Roads and the later

proposal to the Government to make.

this a County Provincial road, and on
down to Ruthven’ by! way of) Harrow
and Kingsville, has been successful.
In reply to a resolation adopted at
the spring session of the Gounty Coun-

prove this route for a County

recaived Friday from: W. A. McLean,
Deputy Minister of Highways in the
Provincial Government: 4
To Wm. Woollatt,

As requested by Cotnty Council, can
approve the Provinefal County High-
way designation for good ronds. from
Ruthven to Amherstburg and the
front road to Ojibway; also the Te-
cumseh road and thé’ Base Line to the
Kent boundary: g

W; A. McLEAN,

This {8 the best news for the whole
district, as under thig system the Gov-
ernment will pay 60% and the County
40% of the construction, besides the
road will have to conform to the speci-
fications laid down by the Provinejal
Department and wi no doubt be one
of the first pieces of work undertaken
by the County. There is some differ-
ences of opinion as to what route
the three municipalities—Amherst-
burg through Malden, ‘as some dis-
satisfaction has arisen in Malden with
the roads designated in the County
system at the lage: session of the
County Councihand representatives of
the three  nMyunjoipadittes—aAmherst-

Celebrated in Amheratburg.

 

As this is the 75ta anniversary of
St. John the Baptist church and 60th
amniversary of the St. John Baptist |:
Society, {t was very fitting that the
annual celebration of St John the
Baptist Society of Essex County
should be held at Amherstburg this
year. and the day being warm and
bright, a large crowd gathered here
Tuesday. The presence of His Lord-
ship Bizhop Fallon lent luster to the
occasion and drew devout worshippers
from all parts of the parish to the
Solemn High Mass, which was cele
brated by-Fr. Burns; . Space this week
will not permit a detailed account of
this important religious function. Fol-
lowing the service, the procession
formed, headed ‘by the: Essex Pusiliers
band, and over 100 mentbers of St.
John Baptiste Society followed by His’
Lordship and a dozen’ priests and
many citizens in an automobile par-
ade ‘to the town park, where they
dispersed and partook of one of the
most elaborate dinners ever enjoyed
at a picnic in Amherstburg, splendidly
served in the Agricultural building by
the ladies of the church... Over six
hundred partook of dinner and supper.
The place was nicely decorated for
the occasion and was most inviting.
His Lordship and the clergy occupied
a special table prepared in -their honor,

The committee then ran off a list
of sports, the winners of which were:
100 yards dash—t. McGibbon, F, Spry.
Boys 10yard dash, under 16—John

“I'm. ready to vow.never to be sympn-

The Hecho office cannot be blamed
for the unusual delay in the Auld
mali last week. It was sent out in the
usual way, but through someone's over-
sight tanded at McGregor. As soon 4s
complaints were phoned this office, in-
quirles were made,
cated at McGregor post office, whose
official was requested to return it to
Amberstburg so that it could be sent
out. In.spite of that, the bundle was
not sent back to Amherstburg until
Monday afternoon, and consequently
couldn’t ‘reach Auld’ P. O. until Tues-
day morning. In the course of events,
had this mail been handled exped!-
tlously aa it should have been, the
papers would have reached our sub-
aerivers on Saturday morning

The sixtieth wedding anniversary of
Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Sinasac, sr.,
was celebrated by them and their fam-
lies Sunday afternoon in a very en:
joyable and happy manner. Some
forty guests brought well-filled bus-
kets, which provided one of the most
delicious suppers that the family is
noted for. Though Mr, Sinasac is in
his S4th year, he is hale and hearty.
Mrs. Sinasac is 79 years old, but is a
partial Invalid. . Of a family of four-
teen, eleven are living: Frank, of
Detroit; Albert, of Windsor; Robert,
of Colchedter; Edward and James, of
Amherstburg; Lorne, Alex, Hattie
(Mrs, John Bondy), Belle (Mrs, Roy
Imeson), of Anderdon; Maud (Mrs,
Dolphus Bondy), of Colchester, and
Miss Vida, at home, <A group picture
of four generations was taken—Mrs.
Sinasac sr., her daughter, Mrs. Adol-
phus Bondy, her daughter, Mrs. Percy
Burns, of Harrow, and her Infant
daughter Maud. The Echo extends
congratulations and trusts that they
may live to gather their family around
them for many more anniversaries,

fear, for that is one of flesh's attri-
butes. and, indeed, Is one of the most
valuable of human possessions, dince
fear ts our protection from dangers
amd harms innumerable. We fear wild
, beasts to avold them, snakes and
spid@s to increase our attention,
‘storms and tempests that we may pre-
pare means of escape from them.

So it was only in battle that chiy-
alry insisted that man should be with-
out fear, or pretend to be.

With the coming of new warfare,
however, all lands at once camé toa
More sane understanding and the old
physical bravery has given place to
moral resolution. The man who now
enters the hell of shell fire, of hurled
fiames and deadly gnses, no longer
attempts to fool himself into the be-
Hef that he is not afraid. He knows
full’ well and only a stupid nature
could avold the knowledge that the
human is at the merey of forces a
million times beyond his own abflity

really believe he was,able to unhorse
all the enemies that rode against him
and therefore might conceivably be
j without fear, but how ean a. soldier
feel that way when facing rhodern
weapons of ‘destruction?

Therefore, it is'no longer a dis-
grace to feel fear or to admit it; the
only disgrace is to allow fear to pre-
vent one doing his duty. How much

finer fiber is needed for this e zw de-
fiance!

 

Need for More Conauls.
The chairman of the shipping board

and the people to the need of enlarg-

j ing our consular service abroad, in

view of the fact that our great: mer
chant marine will be released for use
in foreign trade.

Mr. Hurley tells us, observes the In-,
dependent (New York), that the Uni-
ted States will bave 25,000,000 tons of
merchant shipping by the end of 1920,
and that as fast ag these ships can be
freed from military work they will en-
ter commerce, ‘The present consulates
would be entirely inadequate to handle
this enlarged busines§: There are not
enough of. them, their staffs are too
smell and they are handicapped by in-
@¥pertence with duties that will be de
manded and by antiquated regulations.
Even now the burden of work, espe
clally in the way of inquiries to be an-
swered, is overtaxing the undermanned
and underpaid force. Mf. Hurley
therefore pleads that immediate steps
be tnken to remedy the situation. ‘

“We need more consuls and larger
consular staffs,” he tells us. “If we do
not provide them today and prepare
for thé great growth in our merchant
marineand trade after the war, I fear
that we shall‘suffer a serious break-

“down.”

RECORD PRICE FOR SPEECH

Chauncey Depew Tells of Occasior
When a Few Spoken Words Were
Worth Much Money.

In commenting upon the death of

Mrs, Russell Sage, Chauncey M. De
pew, who knew Mrs. Sage for 40 yenrs
and was an Intlinate associate of her
husband for na longer period, told how
he made a $120,000 speech at her sug
gestion,
Mr. Depew stated that although Mr,
Sige accumulated a vast fortune _he
rarely gave away any money, adding
that the reason for this was the con
fidence which he reposed In the Judg-
ment of his wife as an able and ex
perlenced philanthropist. He said that
years igo he received a letter” from
Mrs. Sage Inviting him to make an
address at the Emma Willard school,
at Troy, N. Y., upon the occasion of
the donation by Mr. Sage to the school
of ‘a lurge sum of money for use in
erecting a building. This was the
school of which Mrs. Sage was a grad-
uate.

“TY replied,” said Mr, Depew, “that
I was so overwhelmed with engnge
ments to speak that it would be im
possible for me to accept the invita
tion.| In answer I recelved by special
inessenger n note from Mrs. Sage,
saving: ‘Russell js going to give
$120,000, Le. will not give one cent
unless yon make the speech, <This Is |
Russell's flrsp exeursion into this field.
Pon't you think he ovght to be ene

HOW'S THIS?

There is more Catarrh in this sec-
tion of the country than all other dis-
eases put together, and until the Inst
few years was supposed to be incur-
able, For a great many years doctors
pronounced it a lo disease and
prescribed Jocal remedies, and by con-
stantly failing to cure with local treat-
ment, pronounced jt incurable, Science
has proven Catarrh to be a consti-
tutional disease, and therefore re-
as constitutional treatment. Hall’s|

those needwd in dressmaking,

The amateur milliner has often dis-
‘coverefl to her sorrow that, although
her hat was smartly designed and the
colors, well put towether, the finished
product showed unmistakable evidence
of home mantfacture, because here
and there the stitches were plainly
visible. For those women who have
not learned to use the blind stitch, a
imple explanation may be valuable:
The needle should be slipped into a
fold of the material and worked
through it, so as to entch the folds to
gether without piercing the top of the
material, The needle is drawn out
from behind the fold and again insert-
ed. from the back and the needle run.
along as before.
