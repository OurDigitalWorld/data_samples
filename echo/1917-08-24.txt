A reply was made by Miss Thurber

Bradford at her home any day - ho
chose to call between 2 and 3 o'clock in
the afterngon. No attention was paid
to this, and, the case having been placed
by Migs Thurber in the hands of detec.

name saying that she would meet
Bradford at any time or place he might
appoint. Miss Thurber then received a
bit of paper on which was written, _
“Lincoln/park, 6, 25, 9 p, m.”

It was evident that Bradford did not

There was no doubt the rascal had

for every possible contingency. What
was I to do? Delay wonld be as dan-
gerous to Miss Thurber aé-to me. I
resolved to go with him and take ad-
vantage of any favorable circumstance
that might arise, So long as he thought
I was Miss Thurber I had a great ad-
vantage of him. I had a thick veil on
my hat, but in the park did not put it
over my face. Later, if- obliged to face
the light it might avail me.

I accompanied my man to a car wait-
ing without the park. We entered It,
and he drove away. Presently he stop-
ped and told me be must blindfold me.
Aftér objecting I consented, and after

When we reached our destination he

Canadian farmers have gone to the
front in considerable numbers. The
Minister of Militia states that as near
as could be cscertained 45,797 farmers
had enlisted, and of these 24,592 came
from Western Ontario.

 

 

 

The Government's Franchise Act is
coming in for a good deal of criticism
Opposition members are questioning
the voting rights of members of the
Canadian army who were not Canad-
jans when they enlisted. There is
also a battle being waged in Commons
over the provisions of the military
voters’ bill, which indicates that the
Government may have the right’ to
place in the constituencles they please

is to be counted. There was much
criticism of the bill in committee Mon-
day, and the Minister of Justice was
kept busy. The Dill decjares that ev-

to vote in a Canadian general elec-

electoral district In which he resided
before enrolment he shall be deemed
an elector of that riding, and have his
vote applied there. If, because of non-
residence or other cause he ‘cannot

The Dominion Cabinet is being re-
organized Hon Robert Rogers,
“Minister of Elections,” who has been
a bone of contention for some time,
placed his resignation in the hands of
Premier Borden Saturday, and it was
accepted Monday. Mr. Rogers based
his resignation upon two grounds:—
1. A charge of delay en the part of the
Government in bringing on conscrip-
tion. 2. Alleged general inactivity of
the administration. He is understood |
to have advocated abandonment of
negotiations for union government,
immediate application of compulsion,
the pessage of asweeping disfranchise-

along straight party Hnes. Premier
Borden is busy in .conference —with
Sir Clifford Sifton, who is credited
with being the chief cabinetsmaker,
at present. It is reported that the new
men whom Sir Cliferd Sifton desires
to see brought into the Government
are: Hon. A: L.. Sifton and H. W,

Attention.—Nothing becomes some-

thing: Household ‘waste becomes
household by-products. If & person
causes two blades of grass to grow
where only one grew before that per-
son is a benefactor to his country. If

a person Causes one Dlade of grass to| 1),

grow where none grew before that
person {s still more a benefactor to
the country, It is needless to elabor-
ate the shortage of male help or the
necessity for thrift at the present
time. Everyone knows:the facts, and
everyone should use their utmost en-
deavors to ayold these consequences,
Despite the fact that prices of waste
paper have been very low for the past
few months the Government is again
urging that everyone should co-operate
in the National Thrift movement by
saving all kinds of waste material
So please bring all your waste papers,
magazines, old acribblers, etc., to the
Patriotic League, Harrow.

The coal situation {a mlready engag-
ing the attention of householders
hereabouts and many are laying in their
supply from Amherstburg, as it is im-
possible to get any in Harrow. As
the same conditions exist at Leaming-
ton and Kingsville, there are many
conjectures as to the cause. The
theory that dealers have boycotted the
Pere Marquette Company because of
délay in handing back cars {s scouted
because that could only apply to Har-
row, as. Kingsville is-éerved by the
W., B.& L. S., and Leamington by the
M.C.R., over which railroad Amherst-
burg ond Essex secure their supply.
The fact that all these dealers, Harrow,
Kingsville and Leamington, have been
securing their supply from the same
source would rather>argue that there
is something wrong wtih the base of
supply, which ought to be investigated

—The river front in the vicinity of
the waterworks was the scen@ of great
commotion on Saturday night about
10 o'clock when two young men from
Detroit,” crosding.to Boils Blanc in a
canoe unwittingly ran into a towline
which threw one of them into the
water, upset the canoe with the other
occupant, and both would have gone
to m watery grave but for the prompt
action of a couple of Amherstburg
citizens; one of whom at Jeast risked
his Mfe in saving one of the boys
from periahing. The young men were
Kroner, of Port Huron,.and Batchelor,
of Oregon, employed in a Detroit ‘fac-
tory.- They came to Amherstburg by
canogsthat afternoon, remained around
town ‘until nearly 10, then struck
across the river to spend the night in
Q mutual friend's cottage at Bois
Blanc point. Being unacquainted with
the lower Detroit river, they didn't un-
derstand by the lights that an upbound
tug was follgwed by two barges, and
paddled into the tow line? which
catching Batchelor under the chin
threw him out, and the canoe relieved
of his weight capsized with Kroner,
who couldn't swim, but had presence
of mind enough to grasp the steel
cable, but his cries for help caused
the tug tg stop and the sjackening of
the line carried the young man under.
Catlike*he hauled himself along to-
the barge, and soonsfound himself out
of water; and taking a death like grip
