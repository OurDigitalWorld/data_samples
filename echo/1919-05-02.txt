The Minister of Railways refterated
his intention in the House, last week,
that before the session ends legisla-
tion 1s expected to ratify the purchase
of the Grand Trunk system by the Do-
minion Government. The situation,
aa jt stands at present, according to
the Minister, is that the Grand Trunk |
authorities in London, In yiew of re- |
sumed negotiations, are preparing
statements in justification of their
claim for a higher purchase figure than
was previously offered.

blue stripes, was holding his left arm
aloft while another similarly dressed
was busy about the stove, In which a
fire’ had been built.

The young woman holding his arm
—t very pretty blonde—smiled plens-
antly and handed him a gluss of water.

“What's happened?” he asked after
he had drunk the water. She explain-
ed In n few words,

“My friend and I were enjoying a-
half day off, strolling nbout the lake,
when we heard you cry out. We found
you lying under o tree, a severe cut
{n the brachial artery, and blood spurt-
ing so.profusely from the wound that
we Were obliged to Improvise this tour
niquet with your, handkerchief and a
Plece of wood, We snw this house
In the distance, assumed that you lived
here, and mannged to bring you here,”

The girl’s fingers holding the arm
were singularly soothing to the feel
of his skin and her smile was one of
the most cheery things he had ever
seen.

“My friend !s preparing something .
for you to eat,” she nnnounced. “It’s
something Ught, Just the thing for
you.” ‘

James felt that it was good to have
this girl looking after his comfort In
this way.

“She knows her business," he decid-
ed. “She's a very capable person, all
right, and that’s what I need.”

One day, 0 month later, while James
was partaking of a ecnnned dinner, he
heard an automobile horn emit several
cronking blasts, followed by the sound
as of a machine coming to a stop back
of the shack.

Soon there was a knock at the door,
and’ {it was thrown open -to admit
Ralph Williamson, radlant with smiles,
The two young men clasped hands
warmly and Williamson was offered
the four-legged stool as a special
honor. .

“Can't stop,” “he remonstrated. “T
Just cnme out to see if you ‘had enough
of hermiting.”

Obtaining no answer, he went_on:

“T've a pleasant surprise for you.
Janet Ellison is out there In ‘my car,
and she> wants you to be her special
guest’ at a house party starting. to-
morrow. She got back just this week,
and Immediately {inquired about you.
Come on and get ready.”

James held up the coffee pot.

“Have a drink,” he Invited, and re
celying n shnke of the head from his
visitor, he poured another cupful for
himself. Dropping In n lump of sugar
he stlrred it ond sald:

‘Tve had enough of hermiting, all
right, Ralph; but Lean't go with you.

perambulating or beating the bounds,
writes Allce Morse. Enrle, in her
“Child Lifé 4n Colonial Days.” - The
memory of boundaries pnd division
lines, of commons, public highways,
ete,, was kept fresh In the~minds of
the inhabitants by an old-time Aryan
custom,—the walking saround them
onee’a year, noting lines of bouridary
and impressing these on the notice
and memory of young’ people, To
induce English boys to accompany
these perambulations, it was custom-

(Contributed by Ontario Department of
Agriculture, Toioto-) os

XTENSIVE experimental work, —

under ordinary conditions,

has shown that !t is a good

plan. to use good-sized séed
potatoes, and to cut them into
pieces of from one: to {wo ounces
in weight, and having tw@, three or
four eyes in each pidce, It is an ex-
cellent plan to throw th? freshly-cut
pieces in finely ground land plaster
or gypsum and to plant the sets im~
mediately-after cutting. The best re-
turns have been obtained by Dlanting
the sets in réws about 28 inches
apart ,And leaving the set8 singly
fr 12 to 15 inches apart in the
rows. In the average of seven years’

seven inches deep that the highest
average results were vbtaifed from
planting three inches, and the second
highest from planting fiye 4nches in
depth.. Under average conditions it
is nsually wise to plant about four
inches but the depth of Planting
would, of course, depend consider-
ably upon the quality and the con-
dition of the soll. If the soll is a
sandy loam, the depth of planting
may be deeper than jn the case ofa
heavy damp soil.

In experiments extendimge over a
period of ten years it has been found
that about four bushels. per acre in-
crease has been_obtained from hilling
the potatoes in comparison with
level cnltivation.—Dr. C, A. Zavitz,
O. A. College, Guelph.

 

Good Combs the Beekeeper’s Asset.

An asset™to the extracted honey
producer is combs, good combs and
plenty of combs. It is sometimes a
problem to obtain and maintain a
gufficient stock, especially if the
aplary is being enlarged. Moreover,
there are several important problems

to break out of the frames, natural-
ly drawn combs usually éontain

chamber or in extracting supers, 18

there is*no other space availatple)
ifthe drone cells ate in the super,
their presence induces the quiven to
leave the brood chamber. It is a
maxim ‘to have gnly combs of all
worker, cells réinfogced with wire; to
this end, full sheets of foundation
are essential and ecomémical.

The best combs are-always pro-
duced during a honey flow, yes, when
there js a surplus coming tn;

part of the’ season, just prior té the
cropping season; yet, regardless of
séason, the best of combs are obtajn-
able only on strong colontes,
Conversely, Weak colonies, without
the.stimulation of the honey “flow,
fail to draw. out the foundation eyen-
fy and fully: holes may even be
gnawed in the foundations, which
holes, when built ing will probably
be filled with drone cells. With care,
frames of full foundation, to be
drawn out, may be supplied alter-

|FARM WATER SYSTEMS

A Summary of Best Available
Types for Stables.

When Pastures Fail the Milk Flow
Decreases Unless Soiling Crops
Have Been Provided — Corn
Silage Will Also Greatly Increase
Milk Yield In Hot Summer.

(Contributed by Ontarto Department of
Agriculture, Toronto.)

N a day’s visit among»the farmers

of Ontario in almost every
county you would run across
quite a number of stables equip-

ped with some form or other of
water system for supplying the farm
stock more or less automatically with
water each day. With few exceptions
every new barn built now is pro-
vided with a water system, Among
the available systems are the follow-
ing, which, in this short article, can
recelye only a very brief description:
Of these probably the most ‘com-
mon js that consisting of a water sup-
ply tank in the hay or straw loft
above the stable, from which the
water runs by gravity Into a regulat-
ing tank on the stable floor, which
supplies the individual drinking
basins with water automatically. The
tank {s usually built of concrete and
the size depends upon the kind of
power used for pumping; if windmill

be used then the tank needs to be
large enough for three or four days’
supply as the wind does not blow
every day. |Under these conditions
a tank 10x 4x4 feet, or its equiva-
lent would be required for 30 head
of stock, Sometimes the concrete
tank is built just outside the stable
wall and underground enough to pro-
tect it again frost, or in one corner
of the stable, elevated enough off
the floor to feed the regulating tank
by gravity. In case pumping is done
by gasoline engine and a smaller
tank is sufficient, a metal one Is sus-
pended from ceiling of stable, In
every case an overflow is necessary.
Many provide means for collecting
the rain water off the barn and run-
ning it into the storage tank so that
in wet weather very little pumping is
required, especially where a large
tank is used. Another method of
filling the storage tank Is by thef
hydraulic ram installéd at the spring.
Still another is by means of a one-
inch pipe-leading from a spring or
other source at an elevation at least
as high as the storage tank. Some-
times where hydraulic ram ‘or grav-
ity system is In use the storage tank
is dispensed with, the water, in the
ease of the former, running through
the drinking basins or trough all the
time’ and escaping to a good outlet
or drain, in the latter the watenJs
Piped directly. to the regulating tank
which in turn supplies the basins or
trough automatically. Again the
water is pumped direetly to tank in
the attic of the house, and the over-
flow from jt supplies the stable with
water. Afid’since the advent 6f the
compression water system we find a
few cases where it is used to supply
the stables as well as the house, the
installation being ~ proportionately
larger than it would befor the house
alone.” Probably no one system, how-
ever, cain be absolutely Feeommended
as best for every case as.the cir-
cumstances pertaining to the source
of supply, amount of cwater tised,
position and ‘elevation of the farm
buildings, ete., always have to be
carefullyrconsidered jn. planning the
ideal water system fomthe farmahouse,
or stable.—R. R.° Graham, B.S.

(1) The Banich system, giving the

town by means of street boxes equip

deagigned to work in connection with
these boxes and {nstalled in the fire-

“his incorporate mechanism operating
anvelectric siren, replacing the pres-
ént steam whistle.‘ The estimated cost
of the 6-box?and 12 tap bell system
“with double siren, $1890. The siren
alone would cost about $1250, which

. {ncludes the necessary stations to turn

in the alarm,
The town bell system would run

_ ™ Mr. Baulch, in answer-toa question,
~. sald the siren alarm would not include

_ ‘This would cost-about $200 more. —

Moved by Mr. Denike, seconded by

Mr: Turner, that the Great Lakes Tow-

Regarding the request of Mrs.
Ciidaret for a reduction on assessment
of her building which was condemned
by the Medical Officer of Health, Mr.
Denike said that he didn't know why
this request should be granted’ It
was onlyea question of installing ad-
ditional plumbing and then the’ house
would rent,

Mayor Park—“What. should haye
been done was to have her brought
before the magistrate and fined for
maintaining a public’ nuisance. A
month’s rent would put the building
in shape.” ©

Mr. Wavis, appearing on her behalf,
pleaded that the old lady is 90 years of
age and didn't have the money to make
the changes required. She had no
children. ;

Mr, ‘Davis, solicitor—“With the con

This raised quite a storm. Mr. Bert-

Dz. McBride—“After the job of as-

Reeye Brown—“If yon are going to

Mr. Crowe left was much better than
it is at the present time,”

Dr. McBride—“It seems funny to
appoint an assessor who never comes
near you when the assessment. {is
made; but.sits in his office and copies
the roll.”

Mayor—"The appointment <of an as-
sessor was left unt(] the last minute,
and the assessor bad to copy a good

DISEASE COMES

THROUGH THE BLOOD}

To Cure Common Ailments. the
Blood Must be Made_Rich
and Red.

Nearly all the common diseases that
afYlict mankind are caused by | bad:
blood—wenk, watery blood polw¥oned
by impurities, Bad blood {athe cause
of headaches and backaches, Tumbago
and rieumatism, debiltity and indiges-
tion,-neuralgin, sciatica and= other
nerve troubles. It is bad blood that
causes disfiguring skin diseases like ||
eczema, and salt rheum, pimples and
eruptions, The severity or the trouble
indicates how impure the-blood is, and
{t goes always from bad to worse, un=]})
less steps are promptly taken to enrich
and purify the blood.” There is«no},
use trying a different medicine for
each disease, for they all come through
the one trouble*-bad blood, To cure
any of these troubles you must get
right down to the root of the trouble
in the dlood. That is just what Dr,
Williams’ Pink Pills do.. They make
new, rich red blood. They simply
purify and enrich the blood, and the
disease disappears. lat is why Dr,
Williams’ Pink Pills have cured thou-
sands of cases after other, medicines |)
had fniled. - Here is proof of — the
power of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to
cure, Mrs, M. Stills,; who resides
near the town of Napanee, says: “I
cannot praise Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
too’ highly. I’ was wery much run
down in health, suffered from fre-
quent spells,of Indigestion, biliqusness,
and sick headache. L had an almost
constant pain, iri my “head and my
housework was a source of dread, In
fact I felt so mi le that life held
but little enjoyment: I was advised
to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pilla, which
I did, and thé result was simplyamar-
yellous, and can-pest be summed up
by saying that thty made me feel like
a new woman, and fully restored” my
health, Y would advise every woman’)
and girl who has poor blood, or is run
down in health to give these wonder-
ful pills a trfal’ I am never without
them in the house.”

At the first sign that the blood fs
out of order take Dr, Williams’ Pink
Pills, and note the speedy Amprove-
ment they make appetite, health
and spirits. You can get these’ pills
brough any medicine dealer or by mail
at 50 cents a box boxes for
$2.50 from’ The Dr. Williams’ Medicine
