CANADA UNDER CONSCRIPTION. | FROM FARM BOY TO MILLIONAIRE

Loftus Cuddy, Former Prominent
Amherstburg Banker, Dies Sud-
denly in New Hampshire—Shetch
of His Life—Burlal in Cleveland.

Loftus Cuddy, millionalre coal and
oll operator, former resident of Am-
herstburg, died suddenly of apoplexy
at Briton Woods, the White Moun-
tains, N Hampshire, Friday noon,
August 24th, in the 64th year of his
age. Mr. and Mrs. Cuddy had gone
there on August 13th to escape the
hay fever season. He had been in the
pink of condition and- his tragic end
was o grievious shock to his wife
and family.

Mr. Cuddy'’s successful life is one
of tle most realistic financial ro-
mances ofthe age. From farmer boy
to multi-nifiifonaire in two score
years is so Infreqeunt-an occurrence
as to be of outstanding importance,
His native home was jn Adelaide
township, near Strathroy, he being
one of twin sons, born to Mr. and
Mrs. James Cuddy. His twin brother,
T. A. Cuddy, of Winnipeg, was at the
funcral. The family originally con-
sisted of twelve, tWo died on shipboard
coming: from Ireland {jn the early
days, and of the other ten, only two
fre “now living, T. <A,, mentioned
above, and John A, Cuddy, of Ade-
ldide, father-of C. A. Cuddy, manager
of Imperial Bank, Amherstburg,

Loftus Cuddy first entered business
as a& young man, in the office of Alex-
ander Johnston, private banker,
Strathroy. - In. 1878 he came-to Am-
Nerstburg and opened a private bank
in the Lake Wew corner in connec-
tion with Mr. Johnston under the name
of Johnston's Bank, afterwards the
“Loftus Cuddy” Bank, Falls Bros,
took this over in 1893 when the Qn-
tario Bank opened a branch in Am-
herstburg. During this time he had
become interested with the Cuddy-
Mullen fueling business in Cleveland,
and following disposal of his
banking interests devoted his whole
attention to the coal fueling business,
his family spending their “summers
here until the fall of 1895, when they
removed permanently to Cleveland
Upon the withdrawal of the Ontario
Bank from Amherstburg he acquired
a partnership in the Falls Bros. pri-
vate bank, and, I} became Imown as
the Cuddy-Falls Co: whi¢h wag. tatten
over Inter by the Molsons Bank.
Cleveland Mr, Cuddy formed a part-
nership with the late Martin Mullen,
continuing in the fueling business un-
ul thelr intereats were absorbed by
the Pittsburgh Coal Co, They estab-
lished the first wholesale fueling
docks equipped with car dumping ma-
chines on the chain of lakes, Later
Mr. Cuddy turned his attention to of
Jis-operations in this fleld of endéavor
being very successful, and his wealth,
the foundation of which was lald in
Amherstburg, increased rapidly until
at his death he was reputed to be
worth seven million dollars. In -ad-
dition to being president of the Vul-
can Oil Co., he was ‘connected as
director and shireholder with o
ber of banks and financial institutions
and was a calculating, shrewd and
methodical business man of large af-
fairs until the last. 1

In Amherstburg Mr. Cuddy was
married to Miss Hélen Brookman,
daughter of the late Rov. Wm. Brook-
MAD erbotor of Christ church, and tley
purchased and resided in the beautiful
home on the river front afterwards
sald to S, Olin Johnson. — Their family
consists off two sona and one daugii-
ter, all born ‘here:—Brookman, with
the British forces in England: Jeffrey,
attached to the U. S. Aviation Corps,
Cleveland, and Ethel, Mrs, Bernett, of
Birmingham; Georgian.

It is a remarkable commentary” on
his ‘attachment to early. associations
and tenacity or purpose that he al-
ways, retained his Canadian citizen-
ship.’ This some trait was seen in
his life long Interest in Christ church,
Amherstburg, which was favored
richly by his benefactions. His great
wealth whs the result of, the atricteat
attention to many and varied business
interests on a magnificent seale; he
never invested a cent in any affair of
& speculative nature. Method and or-
der wore the prominent character-
Istics of his whdle personal and busi-
ness life,

The remains were brought to Oleve-
land Monday night, and the funeral
took place there Tuesday afternoon,
interment being in Cleveland.

NOTED MUSICIAN
OF MONTREAL

Advises The Use Of “FRUIT-A-TIVES”,
The Famous Fruit Medicine, .

 

 

MR. ROSENBURG
589 Casgrain’St., Montreal.
April 20th, 1915.

“Tn my opinion, no other medicine
in the world is so curative for Constipa-
tion and Indigestion as ‘‘ Fruit-a-tives”.
lwasa sufferer from these complaints for
five years, and my sedentary occupa-
tion, Music, brought about a kind’ of
Intestinal Paralysis —with nasly Head-
aches, belching gas, drowsiness after
eating, and Pain in the Back, I tried
pills and medicines of physicians, but
nothing helped me. Thén I was induced
to try “Fruit-a-tives”, and now for
six months I have been entirely well.

T advise any one who suffers from that
horrible trouble—Chronic Constipation
with the resultant indigestion, fo try
“ Fruit-a-tives’', and you will be
agreeably surprised at the great benetit
you will receive”. A. ROSENBURG.

“should be fair®enough to pay for the

Mr. Brown:—"It’s jist a matter of

~—THE ENERGY FOOD

The Vim and Vitality One Gets
From Oats

There is something in oats which creates
spirit and energy. No other grain can bring
results like them. Everyone knows what
oats do for horses. ‘hey have the same
effect on man.

An extract of oats is employed asa tonic.
A_ dict of oats multiptics one's vitality.
That's why cnezgetic men—men of vim
and spirit—are said to “feel their oats,”

In Quaker Oats the finest oats—Canadiar.
grown—are subjected to 62 tings Just
the rith, plump grains are used. ‘There is
only ten pounds of Quaker Oats in a bushel.

These grains have the maximum Of rich-
ness andenergy. They are ulso the most
delicious. Qo cat Quaker Oats once a d.
for a month will show to the Iimit
tonic effects, what bubbling vitaiy
can get from oatmeal. One never knows
how good oat food is, or what it can do, un-
til-be tries Quaker Oats. ,

T am of an artistic temperament.
From my earliest girlhood I had loved
beautiful scenes. I took to drawing
pictures carly and {in time became a
water color sketcher. In summer timo
I drove around in a yehicle called a
rockaway, drawn by an old horse that
had been in my family a long while
and in whom I had every confidence,

At night I would sometimes stop at
a hotel, sometimes at a farmhouse, anif
occasionally would place my blankets
on grassy ground and spend the night
in bivouac.

One evening when I was some miles
from a town, which I expected to
reach before dark, Bob went lame.
Looking about for shelter—for I could
not get on with a lame horse—I espled
a_ short distanco ahead of me, perched
on a ledge, a cottage. It was as artistic
a plece of architecture ag I over. Baw,
with its grounds and vines growing
over it. Indeed, the tout ensemble
constituted a thing of beauty.” If I
could ohly be permitted to spend the
night there I would be delighted,

I managed to get Bob to the gutoway
of the place and up a short winding
road leading to the house. I was dis-
appointed in not seeing any ono about,
and as I drew near it occurred to mo
that’ tho place was unoccupied, The
blinds were not closed and there wag
nothing-to indicate that the house wag
empty. What was it that told me that
the placo wag deserted?

Leaving Bob Standing in the road-
way, I went to the house and rapped
om the front door with a brass: knocker
I€ did not seem to me, if there had
been any one within, that those knocks
would bavye sounded go hollow. I listen-
ed, but there was no indication of any
one stirring. Going around to the rear
I failed to see any indication of a liv-
ing being. There were no chickens, no
dog, not even a lonely cat Only a
few flowers in beds near the house that
I judged grew without being cultivated.
There was a woodshed and some wood
in it, but plenty of room for Bob in
case I should have to leave him there.

Looking, in-at a’ window, I saw a
library with a fine broad fireplace and
among the furniture a large lounge.
The sash was locked, and I went to
other windows, but found them locked
also. A trellis led to an upper window.
It looked easy to climb, and I went up
it and found the gash unlocked. I went
{nto a bedroom and down a staircase.
The front door was Jocked and no key,
but 1 opened a slide door by turning
the Jatch.

I could understand the fascination of
burglary so interested was I in appro-
Priating the premises to my use for the
night: There was a zest in temporarily
owning this place, so beautiful and yet
so desolate, which was enhanced~by
my-having to. break into it and learn
what there. was suited*to my necessi-
tes.

The next thing was to unharmess
Bob and’ give him his supper. Then I
went into the house with my lunch box,
in which I always kept something and
in which I now fortunately had enough
to satisfy my appetite, There wero
cupboards in which'‘eatables might bo
stored, but they were locked. After
eating 1 lighted a lamp in: the library
and looked over tho books. It was evi-
dent that whoever had filled these
shelves was a well educated and intel-
ligent person. I have never before
come*upon a library in which every
book iad a value. And What surprised
me most was that some of the books
were up to date. I read till quite late,
then, throwing “myself on- the lounge,
-put out the lamp and went to sleep.
‘On awakening in the morning I was
astonished to detect the odor of coffee.
What did it mean? Was, tho house,
after all, occupied? Had tho:occupants
returned late? I arose and went into
the dining room. The table was set-for
breakfast, but for only one person,
Hurrying on, I entered the kitchen. On
the range’a kettle was simmering, and
there was a coffee pot that emitted tho
odor. A toast rack stood on tho range,
filled, and a couple of eggs were ready
for boiling.

I started to find whoever had como
in, to apologize for my burglary, and,
not finding any one on the ground
foor, went cautiously upstiirs. Tho

them the night before, but no ono was
{n any of them. The house was as free
from any person except myself as it
was When I broke into it.

1 went downstairs again, looked

about me and listened. There was no

sound save the simniering kettle in the

kitchen,

Was I dn my right mind? Was I
asleep and dreaming? Was Penacting
a play for a movie show?

But the odor of the coffee, the re
aiembrance of the toast and the eggs,
to say nothing of a dish of radishes
tnd some tempting butter on the break-
fast table, overpowered wonder, and,
going into the kitchen, “I boiled ¢
eggs, and, removing them and’ the”

“Tho obigation is all on the other

Turning quckly, 1 saw a man stand-
ing outside the kitchen, his arms rest-
ing on the wndow sill.

I stood looking at him, not knowing
what tosay » him. He was an intel-

together and while it-was building

no pains to make it dainty. AL

The ever-popular “Motor-Steamer”

the-monotony.of the land journey, en-
joy a comfortable night's sleep on
Lake Erie, make progress of 183 miles*
on his journey and awnke refreshed
and eager to reaume his auto trip early
the, next. morning.

This $5.00 round trip rate is made
for automobiles 127 inches wheel-
base or under, (over 127 inches wheel-,
base $9:00,) good for return, within
two days.

C. & B. Line steamers leave Cleve-
land and Buffalo daily at 9.00 p.m.,
reiching their destination following
morning at 7.30.

Ho took it back to the dealer. “Where
did you get that fish?" he asked.
“Why, it came from the Government,”
roplied the dealer. “Well, that fish is
Just like the Government,” satd tho
customer—and the dealer knew what

What every mother knows probably includes a

realization of the fact that boys

are hard on their

clothes and, knowing that, she wants clothes sold by
a retailer who is aware of the same fact.

This‘store is aware of these facts. You can see
it in every boy’s suit we sell---in woollens, the tailor-

ing, reinforcing and taped seams.

Put our boys’ clothing through the hardest sort
of service test and it will come through with flying

colors. ;

We are showing splendid lines of school suits
that spell exceptional values at $3.50, $4.00, $4.50,
$4.75, $5.00, $5.50, $6.00, $6.50, $7.00, $7.50

and $8.00.

these school suits at your earliest opportunity.
