are very pretty and very good values, and where one can
do home sewing a considerable saving in the total cost of

Real Linen for Dresses

: Just as well to read this. None have been offered the
trade for this season’s business that we know of, but we
have a few lines left from last season which are splendid

some time to come.

« SPRING TERM

YOUNG FRIEND:— Lede.

Our Easter term will start Tuesday, April 2nd, and YOU should be
on hand to get the benefits of our training, which will help you to DO
YOUR BIT. or as«the soldier says, TO CARRY ON:

Have filled many good positions the past month, and the demands
for Office Help, the next. few months will be beyond our ability “to
supply. THIS FACT SHOULD SPUR YOU TO START AT ONCE.

We have done no soliciting the past year on 80, yet we have the
Strongest Class of all years—that is"because our graduates never
{all—they sucteed where others do fail. A prominent business man,
when arranging with one of our young ladies thib week to act ~as

~Stenographer, said to us that he bad tried threé girls recently and
that their ignorance really broke his heart.. The Cadman College is
in a class by itself, it stands for Modern’ Business Education and the
highest type of Citizenship and. Moral Influences—these far outweigh

Dollars.

 

EVERYTHING FIRST CLASS;

Our courses furnish the Brick and™Mortar, with which to build

a Successful Career.
Your interests would’be safer in our bands than elsewhere.

We expect several to register before Easter,

» A Red Cross entertainment will be
given in the 1.0.G-T. hall Friday even-
ing, April 12th, under the auspices of
the Malden Dramatic Club, which
promises to be the best in a success-
ful series. Two plays, “The Perse-
cuted Dutchman” and “The Wayfarer”,
ought in themselves to draw a crowded
house. In addition there will be music
by local talent andthe Potter orches-
tra, from Essex” Everybody {nvited
to “do thelr Dit.”

A real estate deal of considerable

dren presented the Tittle girl with a
signet ring and the boys with gold tie
clasps. a.
Francis Gore ~ Hutchins, who for’
thirty-six years lived .on the same
farm; just north of the Methodist
church, passed: away Thursday night.
He was sixty-elght yenrs of age on
Christmas day. It is rather a coinci-
dence that Mrs. Hutchins prédecacad
him two years ago, also passing away
on a Thursday. Mr. Hutchins was a
6on of the late William Hutchins, and
was born-on the lake front, Colchester
South. Ofthe family three are living:
Peter Hutchins, of.Mersea; James, of
Cleveland, and Mrs. Willlam Gegler,
of St. John’s Mich,., all of whom were
in attendance at his bedside during his
last dI1Iness and. algo at the funeral. Mr.
Hutchins: attained manhood in Col-
chester South, and was marriéd there
forty-six* years ago to Elizabeth Best.
Shortly afterwards they purchased the
farm on the Creek Road, Malden,
which he later sold to his brother, the
Tate Silas Hutchins, and purchased
the John Parks place, on which he
died. He was-@ thrifty, hard working
farmer, having a remarkable: capac-
ity for management, and his beautiful
farm with its fine modern residence,
barn and outbuildings are monuments
to his industry; most of it was cleared
from tho solid wood, and a)l tile drain-
ed. To Mr. and Mrs. Hutchins were
born two children—Anna May (Mrs.
Georgo Sellars) and Maurice, on the
homestead., Sha died two years ago
March 2nd. A yoar ago in the. winter
he was taken very ill and underwént
@ serious operation in Detroit, spend-
ing eleven weeks in the hospital. He
never fully recovered from that, and
last January, while attending a poul-
try show in Windsor, suffered-a stroke,
but managed to reach home, and while
he rallied, paralysis gradually crept
on, causing fils death. The funeral)
took placte’Sunday afternoon; a short
service was held at the house by Rev.
Mr, SnelJ, after which’ the remains
\wore taken to Chirat church, Colches-
ter, where Rev. J. W. Connor also con-
ducted services, and “burial wns {n

Robert ‘and Gordon Sellars, “Wiliam
Waldron, eho » Marshall En-
derby and W. H. Bennott. Mr. Hutch-

this week when Theodore Langlois
bought S. Boufford’s fifty-acre farm
at North Malden. The price paid set
n new record for improved farms. Mr.
Boufford had rented ft for this year,
so Mr. Langlots does not get posses
sion for another year. In the mean-
time Mr. Boufford will straighten out
his affairs and take up his residence
with his daughter, Mrs. Louls Barron.

The Malden Red Cross Circle met
at the hdme of Mrs. Wm. Waldron on
Tuesday, March 26th. . Twelve now
members and three honorary members
joined. A bale valued at $90 was sent
to Hyman Halk It contained 6 stretch-
er caps, 18 suits pyjamas, 13 pillow,
cases, 20 trench towels, 14 handker-
chiefs, 39 pairs of wécks.~ The Circle

The Only Thing That Sustains Our
- Men ‘on Land and Sea--Is Food

What re we, each one of us, prepared to do
to insure that Food supply?

Germany, by her submarine campaign, has
seen that great Armada, the British Mercantile
Marine, shrink in volume.

- Germany has seen South America, Austra-
lia, New Zealand, India and far away outposts
q of the Empire practically cut off from:supplying:
‘ eo the Motherland because of the lack of
ships. 4 ;

Forty million Allied mén and women having
been put on war work, food production has dan-
' gerously decreased’in Europe.

’ ) “These forty million. consume more food than,

 
     

there are fewer men for farming. “Hence an in-
creased demand and decreased supplies.

The harvest of France was one-third less in
1917 than 1916, and this year must be smaller
still, owing to lack of fertilizers, which cannot be
supplied through shortage of shipping.

“The submarine destruction of shipping has
made it necessary to abandon the hope of bring-
ing food from South America, Australasia and

India.

“Food must, therefore, be shipped from
Canada and the United States—the nearest and
safest’ route.

“Canadian and United’ States supplies are
normally 350,000,000 bushels short of the Ai-

lied needs. By greater production and conserva-

the United States
must combine to
increase the ex-
port of grain by

‘As the shipping situation makes the Allies
dependent upon the North American continent
for food, it is vitally necessary that Canada
should increase her production of food in order
to take a larger part in providing for the Allies’

it that it would in very truth be a million times
better for the people of these islands to be dead,
every one of them, rather than live on as the
serfs of a triumphant Prussia.” 8

How can any lover of liberty remain insen-

Food means Victory and the world made
safe for democracy—

Lack of food means disaster and subjugation
to Germany.

The Citizens of Ontario Must
Lead This Mighty Crusade
for Greater Food Production

They did it last year and will do it again.

As the greatest food-producing : Province,
Ontario must maintain her leadership in Ameri-
ca. Great are our opportunities—our responsi-
bility is tremendous.

Upon every man and woman, boy and girl,
rests a personal obligation to serve. Every
pound of food produced, in whatever form, is a
contribution to the Cause of Freedom.

Ontario farmers should sow: 500,000. acres
of spring wheat.

* Every Ontario farmer whose land is at all
suitable should put an extra five acres into
ywheat, even at the expense of another crop.

What YOU Can Do to Help

At all costs production must be maintained.

That's why farmers and’ farmers’ sons are
being exempted from military service. Working
on a farm is\equivalent to service in the Second
Line Trenches.

To enable the farmer to do the work two fac-
tors are essential, The first is Time. Whatever
we are to do must be done at once. Nature waits
for no man. The second is Labor. Many farmers
cannot plant the acres they would because they
cannot get the necessary help. Many are afraid
to increase their acreage because they fear they
would not beable to cultivate and harvest an un-
usual crop after they had raised-it. p
, The burden is not
upon the.farmer. Neither can it be placed upon
the townsman. It is a personal obligation upon
se ape poraed girl, in every farm, -
own and city home in the Province of Ontario.
_ AWAY WITH GRITICISM__CO-OPER.
ATE! Mr. City man, don’t say that the farmer
should do so-and-so, and thus allow criticism in
ation’s peril to cripple your
