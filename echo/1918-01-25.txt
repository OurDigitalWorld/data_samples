“Really, Jeanette; trenkfast must be

Inst swallow of coffee, pushed his paper
into bis pocket with one hand, ‘took out

really must speak to Sarah. again.”

“Yes, Arthur, 1 know, but Sarah,” be-
gan poor Jeanette, stopping to quict
Bobby’s demands to “Wall: dust ‘ittle

When the front door had closed and

Jeanette turned. with a sigh to attend
to the many dally dnties of a house
keeper with one incompetent ninid and
two bables. bt i

It was ncbot, sultry morning, the chil.

compliments and roses,” and Jeanette
laughed in spite of herself, but ncross
her memory flashed tho plieture of two
people on a moonlit piazza.

“Are you sure, Arthur, dear,” the

and a thy Oy rippled the surface of the

“Not so bad,” refoleed Jeanette. “I
wish Arthur could see you.” Sbe trie
several nearby pools with no success;
then tho line and fly became hopeless-
ly entangled in a tree. In despair sho
climbed Into the low branch of n nearby
scrub apple tree and with a long stick
way trying (0 poke the line from the
branches of the other tree when it

alipped from her band and fell with a_

crash, She heard a sudden exclama-
mation and, turning quickly, almost
lost her balance. A young man was
standing in the brook behind ber, rod
fn band, his line entangled with hers,
astonishment in his face.

“What'— he began, then stopped. |

“Were you going to say, ‘What om I
doing in this tree?’ I'll tell you what
I was trying to do. Did my stick hit
you?” Jeanette paused for want of
breath.

“Yt did. It hit my arm with that re-

sult,” and the young man waved his |
hand toward the tree full of lines, “But |

what were you doing in the tree? It fs
a good thing you made yourself known
or you might have heard some Jan-

guage. There is a trout in that pool, |

just one, that I have tried for every

held the trout up for his inspection.

a side door clad iv tramping skirt and_

middy blouse. Under her arm was a
‘hook and a long puckage suspiciously
Uke a fishing rod. Over. her shoulder

‘bumg’a ‘fish basket.» She took a-short

 

overhead. In another moment they
wero both at work disentangling the
lines. »
“There! The trick isdone. Is that the
fly he took? It would have been about
my, list guess,” he said. “By the way,
I have a few small trout, and I’m as
hupgry as a benar., What do you say
to cooking them and efting them on
the spot? I know you don't live in the
village, but from’ what you say you
must be visiting there. I’m Deacon
Alden’s nephew, Stephen Alden, and if
you nre visiting relatives you are prob-
ably a second or third cousin- of mine,
You know about every one is related
in a village of this size, so everything
will be perfectly proper, Come on,
cousin, let’s get luncheon,” and -he
laughed with such boyish good nature

and..good will that Jeanette laughed |

also. -

“You certainly sound respectable. I'll
add my trout and sandwiches to yours.
You make a fire and I'll cook the
trout,”

The thought of food brought the ba-
bles to Jeanette's mind, Would they
tive Bobby the right food and* the
baby’s milk? - Brt she. resolptely put
them out of her mind dnd tried to have

tho “good. timiG” that she, would haye |

had Before the advent of Arthur and
the, babes.

Stephen Alden was having a food
time and a “good feed,” and he rattled
on in a happy, cfre free fashion.

In spite of herself, Jeanette answered
rather absentmindedly, How. bad sho
happened to forget (thnt- coat of Ar-
thur’s? Jt should have gone to tho
cleaper’s that morning.

She answered a question about a_re-.

cent novel so vaguely that the young
man looked at-her in a puzzled way.

“Probably not mu of a reader,” he
thought. “She's o mighty pretty girl
ond a, good little companion. Didn't
fuss a bit about smoke or bugs, and she
can fish, Will try her on something
else.” ny

“Oh, dear,” thoucht Jeanette, “I'd |

forgotten what stupid things T,used to
like fo tall: about. Tennis, bal) games,
dancing, were a!) very well, but bow I
would like to get’ hold’ of those blessed
babies. 1 simpjy can't stand it”

“I really must be starting now” for

home,” she began, gathering up her®

things. “It’s been very nice and jolly
and thanks for getting me out of the
mess I was in. No, You must not leave
your fishing. Im not far from home,”

and she jeft so abruptly that Stephen .
Aldén wondered whnt he could possi: |

bly have sald to offend her.
As she came into the village she saw
peoplo hurrying along the street —
