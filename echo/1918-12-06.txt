"TRAGEDY OF THE CASE:

 

The finding of the drowned body of
a handsome woman about 40 years of
age on W. G. Baldwin's beach Tues:
day afternoon reveals one of those
tregedies that oqgur from time to
time from sudden storms coming up
and swamping small gasoline launches
on Lake Erie. The body was attired
only-in underclothing and a fur coat,
with Hfe preserver upon which was
painted the name Graejel II. Detroit,
which proved the means of identifica-
tion. Dr. Mackenzie; . coroner, was
called and after viewing the remains
advised Mr, Madill to place the hody
‘in the little morgue at Brie cemetery
until Inquiries could be set afloat. The
Echo got in touch with the marine
editor of the Detroit News, who ascer-
tained Wednesday afternoon that the

wede), aged 40, of Willow Beach, East
Detroit. Her husband owns that bath-
ing beach. Friday the unfortunate
woman, her son Harold and his friend
Albert Walan, set out.in the 21-foot
gasoline launch Graceil Ik to shoot
ducks, along the American shore, in-
tending to return Sunday. After that
nothing more was heard of them until
the body washed dshore here, telling
fn no uncertain way’ that the flerce
storm of Friday and Saturday had
swamped their oraft and all the o¢cu-
pants perished in the waters of Lake
Erie. The finding of an upholstered
rchair on the beach, lettered the same
as the life presérver confirms this
opinion, “A:close watch is being main-
thined for the bodies of the boys,
whith are bound to come ashore here-
abouts.

The husband of the deceased woman
ent fo Harrow’on Wednesday night,
arranged for sifipping the body to’ De-
troit, and?also fora patrol on the
shore to recover the bodies of his son
and the other young man. —

first view of a concrete vessel Satur-
day night,when the tug Harding stop-
ped at this port with the U.S. 101 in

oa curiosity that mrny took the oppor-

i.,—Mr. Hastings, of the Dominion

Public Works Department, wis in Am-

jsome “important -additions and im-
}provementis..to the post office, which
will add greatly to its convenience and
provide ampl® accommodation for all
present patrons and  boxholders for
some years to conie. A portion of
the present box partition willbe cut
jo from the front and swung round
the north side and extended to the
west to be served by a hallway. This
new face will be filled up with boxes
and drawers of the latest type—378
altogether. -Thete will be added 18
medium sized drawera, 78 large draw-
}ers and 234 boxes. These are now in
Toronto, being nuribered in accord-
}ance with the system already in vogue
here and will be shipped to Ambherst-
burg and Installed in time for the
Caristmas rush» Whert these are all
rented, it ought.to relieve in a large
Measure the congestion, that now ex-
ists by reason of rinny, who desire to
rent boxes of their own, having to be
served from tlhe general delivery
wicket. If,when jthese-imprdvements
are being*carried out, the Department
will also install another general de-
livery wicket for the receiving and
weighing of parcels, so that this work

barhiést victims, ware — the asl
blooded dandemic people whose power
of resistance Is greatly weakened aa
cause Of the watery condition of their
blood When a “person 48. strong,
hearty, able to ‘enjoy a brisk cold
day, chills and “infections are set at

defiance.) But when the fystem is
run do&wn, when the nerves are
shaky and the blood’ watery, the
kerms of: jnfluenza are quick ~to
seize their opportunity, >It is there:
foré good policy to keep the blood

always nich, red and strong, and the
nerves well nourished by the use of
such a réliable tonic as Dr. Williams”
Pink Pills, «People who take these
pills from time to time are usually
able, to resist colds, influenza and
other , allments,~ and enjoy - good
health while many about them are
weak, allfig and miserable.

To those Who have been Attacked
by dnfluenzh, the after effects’ are
more dangerous than ‘the attack it
self. They*are left at the mercy of
}relapses and scomplications. There
is a persistent weakness of the limbs,
shortness of breath at the Jenst ex-
ertion, poor digestion and a tandency
to fuke cold easily. This—condition
will persist and will grow .worse un-
‘Tesa the blood is: built up and the
shattered nerves strengthened., For
this purpose there {fs no” tonie can
equal Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, From
first to lost dose these pills make
new, rich, red blood; which reaches
every organ and every nerve in the
body. Thus the lingering germs
are driven out, the appetite {is im-
proved, and: weak, despondent vie-
tims of influenza are transformed
into cheerful, healthy, happy men
and .women. If you have passed
through an attack of influenza you
will find Dr. Williams’ Pink Pilla
the one thing needed to restore you
to ‘full health and strength. If the
trouble has passed you, you can
further strengthen yourself nacainst
its insidious advance by the use of

THE AMHERSTBURG ‘ECHO.

Suffered Since.
Childhood
Kideeys at the Root of the Evil

Think of it! ‘The j ‘The joys of youth
marred by agonizing pains, and all
hopes of a bright foture blotted out
by thoughts of a life burdened with
Backache and other sufferings.

Such was the case of Mr. A. Cail
until a good friend advised him that
there was a remedy for his trouble
and he would find it if he used Gin
Pills. Read what Mr. Cail saya:

“I was troubled with my Kid-
neys since childhood and eat a
large amount of money on doc-
tora trying to get cured. Instead
of getting better I kept getting
worse until a friend of mine ad-
vined me to try Gin Pills. I did
eo, and after taking one bor 1 was
able to get out of bed and walk
around. Two more boxes relieved
me completely and since then I
have had no return of the trouble.”

This remarkable testimonial wag
written by a man whose statement can-
not be doubted. Mr. Cail’s reason for
writing this history of his case was—
gratitude for the relief that Gin Pills /
brought him. Wouldn't you do the
eame if your case was similar? If you
suffer now—don't suffer any longer.
Use Gin Pills and obtain relief from
Kidney or Bladder Trouble, and the
pain, suffering and inconvenience that

“Mny I see that paper, please?”
“Certainly.” Then. Miss Borden
busied herself some minutes in the
reading of the article in question. She
started to read it again. At a endden
exclamation from her Robert looked
at her inquiringly. 3:

“Where did you say you. used to
live?” .

‘Morton, Ky.” ?

“But, look, this notice reads. “Aiss

can't Be your Ruth!”

Robert snatched the paper eagerly
from her and for a long time studied
the cut. “No” he satd at length,
“there can’t possibly 6e -two Ruth
Hamptons who look sufficiently alike
to be sisters,

“There has been time enough for
themsto have traveled clear around the
world, for all my knowledge’ of Ruth
and her mother; so withent a doubt.
the simple truth is that they have gone
to California to Live,”

He sat a while in troubled asllence,
and at Jast tried to fix his attention on
some briefs. It was uscless. His mind
wandered continually; and he asked
himself over and over “Why do I care,
why do I cafe?” There could be but
one answer! ;

Atnoon he tunched absent-mindedly.
Before returning he visited a Western
Union office and sent "@ telegram to
the postmaster of Morton. Of course
the message was an inquiry regarding
Ruth. But his conclusions of the morn-
ing were Gynfirmed by the answering

greetings were cordial, but Peters’ em-
barrassment increased ; his tongue. was
about as active as the limbs of an
athlete who has been bed-ridden for
some weeks. Mrs. Hampton, being of
the same cloth as all tactful mothers,
presently withdrew.

“Bob,” Ruth demanded, “what on

it to her silently, the cut and article

LAKE HAS APPROPRIATE NAME»

Body of Water In Eastern Turkestan
Resembles a Pendulum’ in Its
Regular Swing. P
Lake Lop-nor, the wandering Inke of
the desert of, Tayln-makan, in eastern
Turkestan, 1s the termination of the
River Tarkin. Like a pendulum, the
lake has swung from th@ south to the
north of the desert, and back again,
since the memory of mans _ The wan-

Pderings of the Inke fire a tradition

hnnded down from father to son for
centuries. The natives of the Inke
sliore have always followed the. wa-
ters, F :
At present Lop-nor Is {n the south-
ern part of the desert; a shallow
reedy body of-water hardly deserving
the name of Iake. Murky and unplens-
ant, it furnishes a livelihood to the in-
habitants ofits banks, the majority of
whom are fishermen.” In thelr frail
aballow bonts. they cut through the
reeds, fishing and‘ hunting for water
fowl! along thé banks. -In some places
tho reeds are, too thick to admit the
passage of the boat; {n such céses,
howeyer, {t is possible to walk over
the water on rafts of dried and rotting
stems: The chief nntive delicacy ts
the-eggs of the reed-birds. *

*,Lake Lop-nor is one of the hottest
plitces on the map {n the summer and
the coldest In the winter, During the
winter months the lake is entirely fro-
zen over, the temperature diving to 20
degrees below zero. In the summer
the comBinatidn=of a temperature of
306 degrees and the innumerable files
nnd mosquitoes which swarm on the
banks make Lop-nor anything but a
summer resort.

The explanation of the lake's wan-
derings lles fp the fact that Tarin car-
ries every year quantities of silt to the
lake bed, which slowly rises. In time,
no hundred years or so, the river must

ing on the well was commenced in
July.

To Cut in On Main Line.

The exact depth at which the gas
was struck has not been divulged, but
Manager Pearson, of the company,
stated that the new well would be cut
{n at once on the main line running
from the Bow Island field, and supply-
ing Lethbridge, Calgary and -other
cities along the line,

While the new well is naw producing
4,000,000 cuble feet dailythere will
not be this much added to the-pres-
ent gas supply, somply for the reason

(iat: Uie piyssure In -the-main tine is:

such, at present,that only about 1,-
000,000 cubie feet of the 4,000,000
available from the new. vell will enter
the line. The fmportance of the new
well as a reserve, of course, goes with-
out saying. «

Entirely New Field.

The greatcst importance of the new
strike, however, {s the discovery of an
entirely new gas field, separate and
apart from the Bow Island field. So
important {8 the find regarded by the

company that plans ~are being made |,

for a big program of development in
the new field, and four or five more
wells will be sunk next sumiiér.

T@e exact location of the new well

LLOYD GEORGE'S GREAT SPEECH

 

David Lloyd George, the British
Prime Minister, In a speech on Friday
gnid the victory of tlie Entente Allies
has been due to the ceaseless valor
of their men and that It would be a
lesson to anybody who, in the future,

thought that they, as the Prussian | ww
wir lords hoped, “could overlook this Princfpal of Alma Ladies” College at

little island in their reckoning.”

“We are now approaching the Peace
Cofiference,” ‘the Premier continued.
“The price of victory is. not vengeance

}xo retribution. It {s prevention. First,
ofall, what about those people wham:

we have received without question Yor,

years to our shores; “to whom we
gave equal rights with our own sons
and daughters. and who abused that
hospitality to betray the land, to plot
against security, [0 spy upon it and to
gain such information aa enabled the
Prussian war lords to inflict not pun-
Ishment but datege and injury upon
the land that had received them as
guests? Never again!’

Mr. Lloyd George sald the interests
of security an@ fair play dermiinded’
that It should be made perfectly clear
that the people who acted in this way
merited punishment for the damage
they had inflicted.

Must Pay to the Limit,

The second question was the ques.
‘on of indemnities, the Premier add-
ed. In every court of justice through-
out the world the party which lost has
had to bear the cost of tho Mitigation.
When Germaiy defeated France she
established this principle, and there
was no doubt that the principle. was
tho right one: Germany must pay tlie
cost of the war up to the Hmit of her
capacity. ,

“But I must.ase one word of warn-
ing.” said Mr. Lioyd George... “We
hayo to-conslder the question of Ger-
many’s capacity. Whatever happens
Germany is not to be allowed to pay
her indemnity by dumping cheap
goods upon us. That is the only limit
to’ the principle that we are Jaying
down. She must not be allowed to pay
for her wanton damage and dovasta-
tion by dumping cheap goods and
wrecking our Industries.

“There is a third and last point. Is
no one to be made responsible for the
war? Somebody has been responsible
'for o war that has) nthe ‘lives of
millions of the best young — men | of)
Europe. Is not anyone'to be. mado,
responsible for that? ‘If not, all 1 can
‘way io thot if this is the case there is
one justice for the poor wretched |
‘criminal and another for kings and
emperors.” — on ote SARS

is British Colunybia, There nearly all

=a farcup in the Ochils, away beyond

 

ledge among thé rocks and heather,
Allan Water is never disappointing.
In its short course it presents many
and varied pictures. A passage along
its banks is like a journey up the
Alps in early summer. There one
passes through all the seasons in a
few short hours. In the valley the
| elds are fresh and green, mottled
with wild flowers, and then, as one
leh $s the mountain side, summer
gradually gives way to spring, and
spring to winter, with the snow piled
high on the summit. So it is with
Allan Water. Its even calmness at
the Bridge of Allan gives no hint of
the turgid stream which, in the days
of spas, rushes through -Blackford,

Simple Rules for Economical
Feeding. =

1. Grow as much of your own feed
ais possible.

2. Utilize roughages to the grent-
est degree possible.

3. Keep feeding stalls and pens

well lighted, dry, clean and. well
ventilated.

4. Feed regularly.

5. Make changes in rations grad-
ually. f "

6, Feed only What {s eaten up
clean and quickly at each feed.

7. Hayescléan fresh water. before
the stock at all times, ~
8. Study the individuality of each
animal,
9..Feed, mixtures where possible,
as a varicty of food is more palat-
able, and palatability is a factor in
digestibility.
10. Cit feed to avold waste.
11. Make a wide use of oats whicli
should form the basis of all our grain
rations.
12. Always be kind and quiet with

the stock. It pays. ;

13, Study market values of feed,
and compound balanced rations ac-
cordingly, in order that the cheapest
available be used,

14, Seo that the stock gets regular
and ‘sufficient exercise. *

15. Keep all feeding troughs, man-
gers and utensils clean.—Prof, Wade
Toole, Ontario Agricultural College,

The Proper Ration for Horses When
the Fall Work Closes.

When the fall work is completed
and the hard-worked horse4s at the
beginning of hia long period of idic-
ness, feeders naturally plan to change
the “ration and ‘tarry the horse
through the winter as clieaply as pos-
aible, The horse’ should get exercise
régularly. He should not be taken
from regular hard work and tied up
jn a stall day in and day out, If pos-
fible, the work should gradually easq
off and the feed, particularly the
grain ration, should ~be. cut down
accordingly. The idle horse may be
wintered ‘almost “wholly on rough-
ages. Good clover hay, or better, a
mixture of clover and timothy woll
cured will serye as the main winter.
feed.» Roughages arealways cheaper
than grain, and where hay {s avail-
able the grafp ration of the idle
horse should be very small, but if
horses aro fed straw in placeof hay
a small grain ration is required to
keep them from losing in flesh, A
few roots are beneficinl, a good-sized
turnip once a day. ora few carrots
will be found to ald. digestion. If
hay is not_plentiful straw may be
substituted at the noon fed ond
roots given with it. In feeding hay
'make the morning and noom-ration
smaller than the night feed, giving
about aa much at night as at the two
other feeds, Idle horses should bo
fed threo times daily. .If any grain
whatever is fed make ft rolled oats
and it fs not necessary to give more |,
thi a quarter the amount used when
the horses are at hard work provid-
ed plenty of good hay is available.

FUEL SITUATION
WILL BE *SERIOUS

 

 

In a statement issued from thie office,
of the Ontario Fue] Administrator, it
is pointed out that the anthracite fuel
situation in this province will doubt-
less be serious, and that it will be
necessary fo get along-on about 30
per cent. Jess anthracite coal than was
used last year. "

Among other circumstances that fur-
ther limjt..tlre allotment is thé epi-
demic of Spanish Influenza, which has
reduced the anthracite coal produc-
tion by 1,500,000 tons in two weeke.
It {s not likely that any portion of
this can be made up, and - the epi-
demic is pot stamped out in the min-
ing districts yet.

There’ is at present
stock of buckwheat.conl in*the hands
of the dealers, as well as high-grade
bituminous, which the public Is advis-
@d” to. secure-to make upany dofic-
jency”in the supply of hard coal-of
fegular size.

“Speaking generally, there {s no
longer any doubt that the anthracite
situation in the Province will’ be seri-
ous, and ‘unless the public cooperates
andy; where possfble, take steps to pro-
tect itself itself by the substitution of
wood, buckwheat and Bituminous coal,.
conditions may become critical. There
is, however, no reason for panic,’ and
we will come through the winter sat-
isfactorily if we, one and all, save
coal and co-optrate in the observance
‘of the fue) regulations. for the spirit
which won the war can, and will, solve
every peace problem,” says the atate-
ment.
