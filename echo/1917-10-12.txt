DR. CREELMAN'S ADDRESS.

When the Union Fair Bonrd ar-
ranged for the visit of Dr. Creelmun,
Provincial Commiswioner. of Agricul-
ture, to the eek Amherstburg
they expected that he would haye
sometiing of a distinctly practical
fixvor and of decided: Iniportance to
say to the loulturints of this dis:
trict, and he did not disappoint them.
His drive of a couple of days through
the county gave ‘him an excellent

advent of prohibitien of 'Rtrong drink,
and grapes are now double the price
er ton they were a year ogo. This,
he believed would turn the attention of
many again to grape cultivativa..
“This is a day,” said he; “wo should
give’ serlous heed to things of the
fiesh, and do what we to help the
Allies. -We should. obey the’ advice of
the Food Controller and less whent

Dr. Creelman ridiculed the idea of
it beimg an easy mantter,for the far-
mer to get help from those who know
nothimg about farming. {| “The only
way to help the farmer,” he declared,
“is to enable him to grow better crops

farmer and nobody saves moré. The

Dr. Creelman also touched on the

erles, and the uniformity in this pro-
duct that ham grown out of that.

As a proof that his address made a
deep. impression, already farmers {n
this section are getting. information

TOWN OF ESSEX.

| Russell VanEvery of the Royal

Mr. atid Mrs,,W. H. Richardson Tues
day evening at 6.20, when their dangh-
ter Ada ‘was united in mapringe to
Norman Davies, B.A., the ceremony
being performed by the groom's fath-

MILITARY SERVICE ACT.

Rogarding the application of the
new Military Service Act, the follow-
ing {iiformation has been given out:—

Cases of exemption will be deter-
mined by a civil tribunal, composed
of representative men who are familiar
with Tocal conditions, and not by the

military authorities, nor by the Goy-|-

ernment. Later, on, a provincial ap-
Pellate tribunal, constituted from the
existing judiciary, will be provided to’
correct mistakes made by the local
tribunals, and similarly a central
appeliate tribunal for all Canada will
be constituted from among the pres-
ent judges of the Supreme Court of
Canada. In thyl way, every man may
rest assured of fair play and full con-
sideration of his circumstances and
the national requirements, both clvi}
and military.
The Proctamation,

The proclamation under the Mill-
tary Service Act will be {sued on
Saturday, the 13th of October. On
that day, and within a set number of
d@iys thereafter, every man between
the ages of 20. to 34, who were unmar-
ried or widowers without children on
July 6th, 1917, must report for ser-
vice, unless he has made~application
for exemption.

How to Apply for Service or Exemp-
tion.

All applications for service or ex-
emptions must be «made at the post-
office, where printed forms may be ob-
tained. This duty is the only one
which will be required by public no-
tice to be performed. Of anything
required thereafter, every man will be
noUfied’ by registered letter. -

Application in* Person.

It’ is nottat nil necessary for any-
body to appear before the tribdnals
in writing, and {t Js therefore request-
able that everything should be done
in writnig, and it is therefore requeat-
ed that udyantage should be generally
taken of the facilities for written ap-
plication, F

Early Report Advantageous.

No nin because he reports for sert
vice on the first day of the proclam-
ation, will be called to join a battal-
fon or to go Into camp one minute be-
fore the last man who so reports for
service. Nor will any’ man who Te-
ports for service be celled unt!) the
local tribunels have given thelr decis-
fons upon the appltcation for exomp-
tions which will comé before them:

Thus no advantage will be gnined by ff

delay, nor disndvantares incurred by
prompt report for servico on the part
of those who do not {ntend to apply
for exemption.

What a Man Should Do,

The first thing. on and within a set
number of days after the proclnmation
(the number of tlikse ~dnys ill be
stated insthe proclamation) {8 to pro-
ceed at’once to the postoffice and
secure elther a report for seryice or
&' clilm for exemption, sign it up, and
recelve the official report signed by
the postmaster. Then wait quietly,

WILL POINT PELER BE SAVED?..

Le good liard’ work will do it’ the
citizens of Leamington and district
will gave half a million dollats’ worth
of fine property at Point Pelee from
the sandsuckers, which have been
steadiny cutting away the banks for
many months. A hugely-signed poti-
tion was recently sent to Ottnwa urg-
ing the Government to take'immediate
steps to sayo the lard, Mayor Wigle
hos received word back that the.matter
has been referred to the Minister of
Juetice, and that an order will be-{s-
sued forbidding the use of sandsuckers
at Point Pelee,

The department at Ottawa suggest-
ed that petitions be sent as soon as
porsible to the Ontario Governnient,
also urging that it take action to save
the property. These petitions arenow
being circulated, and are being signed
by. thousands of residents of this sec-
tion. The Daughters of, the Empire
have been very active in the work of
circulating the petitions.

People who hnve visited the spot
declare that a whole’ fleet of. sand-

suckers hes been iit work hauling the}.

gravel away to border towns. The’
captaing of the boats think it 2 huge
joke to make in of the people whose
property they are destroying, jt is
said, and make ‘all sapts of insulting
remarks,

The practice by school teachers of
throwing open the windows of their
class rooms, through which children
catch colds; will be stopped, is a re-
commendution by School Inspector
Edwards, of London, to reduce the
teppperature in the rooms is carried
through “Complaints have been made
by the parents of many children that
when they are in school the teachers
apen the wondows and a6 the children
hgve-ol their outdoor clothing. they
auffer, and wile this practice is _con-
trary to the rules of the board of edu-
cation, it is sald that many ofthe
teachers do it, The rules of the board
fireethat no window is t) be opened
exceptiwhen the ‘children are out of
the classroom, and,when found. open
by any of the offiGialsyot the» board
they are closed. Jit Edwards sug-
ats that a uniform,temperature of

that humidity of thé alr BG maintain-
ed atbetween 60 and 60 per cent,

—Resolutions condemning food pro-
fiteering ahd demanding action by the
Dominion Government in reducing the
cost of foodstuffs, were adopted by the
éxecutive board of the Im-
perial Order, Daughters of the Em-
pire, at Toronto, Friday. “We desire
to place 6p record,” read the resolu-
tion, “aur protest against the high
cost of living and the rising prices. of
all necegsary foods which make it im-
possible for a large majority of wo-
men to give proper-nourishment to
| their“children, and’ whereas, There is
a strong feeling among the women of
Canada that he increased cost
living ia unwarranted and only.to*the
advantage of the profiteers, we, 13 an
order representing 40,000 woumer tin
all parts of Canada, would request the
Government to take such ateps™to
regulate the price of foodstuffs and
their uses, that the people may be able
to obtain the nevessities of life at
reasonable cost, and that such food-
| stuffs may be conserved for our men

—"The utterances of a man “who
knows nothing about, it and thinks
he has said something,” is the way in
which Thomas Rowe, grand senior
Warden of the Ontario Masons replied
to the statement of Rey, J. P. Mc-
Leod, pastor of the Presbyterian
church of Wyoming, who urged Mas-
ons to throw open the order to women
as well as men . “The fact of the mat-
ter Is that it is against all the ancient
rules of Masonry to ddmit women and
for anyone to suggest it shows that he
is entirely ignorant of the whole foun-
dation of Masonry. Why, the order
of Masons was once composed of prac-
tical workifig masons, and even to-day.
you don’t see women working as mas-
ons. The workmen formed the order
and it became popular and other men
who were not Masons were allowed
to come in as free masons: That is,

—The bureau of statiatics of Can-

 

provinces, which says ‘that there is an
increase of 8 per cent. in Canadian
wheat this year, Although the num-
ber of bushels to the acre js not so
large as the two years preceding,
which is due to -tlfe large increase in
acreage, the total umount available
will be much greater than last year.
It is estimated from reports of the
district investigators, that there will
be 249,164,700 bushels of wheat this
year. This willbe approximately 14.88
bushels to the acre, In 1916 there
were 17 bushels to the acre, and 29
to the acre in 1916. Alberta, Sas-
katchewan and Manitoba are the larg-
est wheat growing provinces in the
Dominion. The report saya that the
general crop conditions all over the
Dominion are very good at this time
and that the frosts will perhaps not
hurt that part which has not yet been
harvested,

A Few Facts about British Red
Cross Work.

The British Red Cross Society is the
only institution which carries volun’
aid to the Sick-and Wounded of the
British forces on land and sea in every
region of the War.

Its work is therefore the concern of all
clisses of British subjects, whether livin,
in the British Isles, in the Dominions an
Colonie? beyond the seas, or in foreign
countries. i

With regard to «thé régistration of
the soldiers’ vote overseas it ~ Is
thought that this will be done during
the four weeks between’ nomination
day and election day “here so that
definite’ results may be known soon
after tho election day in Canada.
