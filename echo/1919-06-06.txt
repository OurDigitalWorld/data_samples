unfair when compared with houses
where a great deal of water fg used.
The rate to domestic users should in
all fairness be based upon Ure num-
ber of rooms and inmates, and no
doubt the council. will consider -thifs
very carefully. before adopting a rate
that on the face of it Is unjust. After
all this is the most importart rating
in the new schedule as touching the
greatest number of people. As it
is necessary to raise nearly $10,000
from the people in general, {t is very
ingportant that the largest water users
ghould pay an adequate proportion
of the cost of the water.

SUNDAY DROWNINGS.

 

, This strong thrilling war melodrama

will be shown at the Burg Theater,
Amherstburg, Wednesday evening,
June 11th. It is an elght-reel picture,
Which has attracted ‘wider attention
than any other war film.

The story concerns the adventures
of the Parcot family, two sisters and
thelr miétter.. The latter js travelling
in: Belgium with one daughter when
the war breaks out and -they are
caught in the toils of the Germans,
The mother writes to her daughter in
New York telling or her plight, and
she leaves for Belgium in company
with Noel Windsor, who has enlisted
for work with the Committee for tho
Relief of Belgium. }

The comedy relief is supplied by
the antics of Freckles, who keeps the’
audience in rdars of laughter when-
ever, he makes his appearance on the
screen. The work of the youngster of
twelve is one of the outstanding fea-
tures of this remarkable production.

The mother and daughter are forced
to submit to rough treatment at the
hands of the Bosche, and when they
are starving, Freckles conies to the
rescue with food t® relleve®their hun-

When John Lawrence left his home
on the outskirts of town and took the
little path alohg the rallrond he
walked as though he were trending on
air. His heart wns to tune with all
Yae world and the tutumn sun, just
seiting, seemed a great pot of gold, nt
the end of his day's rainbow, beekon-
ing tim on toward éverlasting happi-
ness, LillithYhad given him to under-
stand (hat afternoon that she really
eared—Lillith, who had coquetted with
him eyer since she began going away
to school, There could be no mistake
about her attitude this time, her open
encouragement permitting but one in-
terpretation.

"May I come=—tonight?” he had whis-
pered as he was leav|ig her,

“Try and see,” Sho unswered coyly,
wafting him a putterfly kiss from the
tips of her fingers. And he was golng
to her now. He bad determined to set-
tle the future (bat véry evening, come
what may, and be was thinking with
honest pride, #8 he jvalked along, of
the comfortable nestege in the savings
bank which. fe could offer Lilith.
When he was almos¢ in front of the
house le heard a sgund of laughter
and merrymaking fram within, like a
discordant note in th song his heart
was Singing, '

“Bother take it!” hd muttered. “Why
couldn't she have begn alone tonight,
of all times?”

“Here he is!” shouted Lillith gayly,
answering ~his ring; “let's make him
stir the fudge.”

He was dragged playfully into the
living room, divested of outer gar-
ments and adorned with a huge ging-
ham apron, which Lillith tled under
his arms, is
“Domestic rolesAfre very becoming,”
she whispered th a blushing smile
which get his feart to beating a brisk
tattoo, “Here's the spoon, and don't you
dare stop beating until I give you per-
mission.”

She closed his fingers over the spoon
with an affectionate pat, turned the
blaze a trifle higher under the chafing
dish, and then left him to play a duet
with Hugh Birch; Still John had no
thought save that of being In Lillith’s
home for just one purpose, which he
meant to accomplish in spite of vis-
{tors

“Why fill the hilarity here this eve
ning?” he iInquiredecasually of Nell
Blakesly, who had taken a place be-
side him.at the table,

“Nothing special that I know of. Lil-
lith just telephoned late this afternoon
that she thought a chafing-dish party
would be-fun, so we all-canre" over,”

Lillith Anderson had resorted to her
old trick of playing with fire once too
often, John was confident she must
have known what he was coming for

‘) and, with the courage born off déspera-

tion, h& decided there Was 00 ‘time like .
the present, a:

“Lilith, come here,” he cabled.

The new: note of determsmation® in
his sudden ‘command.startled the girl
into obeyingsat once, "2 thinig she was!
not in the habit-of doing.

“At yor service, cfjptain,” she
mocked, saluting, soldier fashion, as

;she slipped into the chalir yacated by
Nell. “Budge ready?” ”

“T don’t know a thing about it; and
neither do I care n Map!” he anSwered
doggedly.’ “@ cam@ here to see you
alone and you (deliberately planned

“Love is like the red, red rose,’”
she sang, ‘interr\jpting him, whille she
took the spoon from his hand, turned

| depended upon \t, “Now, fellow citl-
zens,” she called out, “we'll soon have
something delectable *to please your
sweet teeth, {2 john will carry it out

She poured the fydge upon a platter
and held it out ts him in such a half-
frightened, pleadiiy way that, as usual,
he’ fell before {je spell of her yonder-
ful eyes and ¢ound himself carrying
the candy obedleytly to the back porch.
But a dash of the bracing night air re-
estabUshed his determination and he
tore off the aprdy as he strode angrily
into the hall, “,gust you go, John?”
Lilith ;asked timidly, with a faint
note of concern jf, her voice. :

“T shall not Slay here and have you
mock me for Os more second! You
knew—you must Have known—I was
coming here tonlent to’ask you to be
my wife, and ¥5u've played with me

He led her {nfo the vestibule and
shut the door, just as the rest of the
party adjournes to ‘the back porch to
examine the cadiy, go théy were alone.

“Will you M&try me?” he went on,
taking her face jjetween his hands’and

pled’ wi own thoughts to notice
the misplaced rail in the trnck toward
which the heavy triln was whirling
with incrensing speed from the down
grade behind, He had just time enough
to jump aside when the engine crashed
through one end of the little bridge
‘and derailed the two or three cars be
hind it. ;

Almost {nstantly the night ofr was
filled with cries of hysterical women,
frightened children nnd the moans of
the injured, and John Luwrence, for-
getting himself and his troubles com-
pletely, rushed forward to” offer ts-
sistance, In ap incredibly short time
mnost of the town had flocked to the
scene of the wreck. John worked hard,
pulling away pieces of wreckage, put-
ting out fires which started in many
places and carrying the Injured to
places of safety. ,

With a little child in his arms he
wns passing beneath the glare of a
brakeman’s Inntern when two, bands
grasped his arm and o frightened voice
ericd out:

“Thank God, you are safe! T watched
you start home this way and I was
afraid you might have been killed.”

He placed the child upon n heap of
neurby blankets nnd gathered the sob-
bing girl in his arms,

“Would you have cared, Lilith?”

“I—should—haye—died—too!” — she
whispered. “And, John, dear, I'll never
try to tense you nagiin.”

AS TO MEN AND HUSBANDS

According to This Writer There Is a
Subtle Distinction Between
the Two Species.

 

Immediately after the wedding cere-
mony men become dull and uninterest-
Ing and turn into husbands, says a
writer in Judge, Husbands are all
just alike and can be sorted out of any
social gathering by the sume set ex-
pression about the eyes and-mouth.

It is more trouble to teach a hus-
band to fetch and carry than a fox
terrler puppy, and as a rule the puppy
acts much better when there [s com-
pany around. Husbands walt until
some Sunday morning when you have
distinguished guests with you for ‘the
week @nd. They burrow in the back
of the closet and-pull things off the
high ‘shelves and go through the.rag
bag. Then they appear gt the break-
fast’table in the coat of-one sult, the
trouserS of another and a fancy vest,
with an inch-wide tie tled in a four-in-
hand as a finish.

And when you advertise your hor-
ror in a frantic effort to convince the
visitors that he Is suffering from tem-
porary aberration any ond every hus-
band will assume an pir of bewildered
innocence and say:

“Why, what's the matter with this?
It's just what I.wear every Sunday
morning when there's no one here!”

Husbands always keep the Sunday
papers on the floor. No man ever does
this until he fs married; His mother
will not Tet him.

Husbands read to you the printed
recipes they find on the woman's page
of the paper. They get enthusiastic
about some dish they have always de-
clared they would rather die than eat
and say: %

“Now, there’s an Idea for you. Why
can’t we ever have something Ilke
that?” i

Women acquire a husband for much
the same reason that 2 man gets a
eane, They are a fearful botlrer, but
one presepts a_better appearance with
one In titmd. t ‘

WASPS: SWAYED BY EMOTION

Observations Made by Naturalists
Prove That They Have Qualities
Akin to Human Beings.

A book, “Wasp Studies Aficld,” by
Phil and Nellle Rau (Princeton Uni-
versity Press) maintains, glving in-
stances, that Insects—wasps, to ba, ex-
act—feel and display” emotions,

The evidences are, plausible. A

with unmistakable viciousness. When
later some meddiesome ants ap-
proached her burrow she kicked at
them aogrily and curled her sting
menneingly. :

Another \species certainly displayed
anger when’ a, spider she was pursu-
{ng made one leap and escaped, She
grew frantic; she became so excited;
over her discomfiture that she acted
madly; walking, leaping and running
about the ground in a frenzy till she
tumbled into a mole's ‘hole.

Still another wasp, @xamining bro-
ken “ground in’ search for her prey,
acted calmly, till she arrived at a cer-
tain’ pile of loose earth. Her demean-
or instantly, changed as. she “struck
pay dirt.” “She became greatly ex-

cited, nérvéus and quivering with.

eagerness.”

One's Own Interests.

The woman no longer young who Is
earning her livelihood should make-it
a point to save a certain portion of
her salary weekly, no matter how small
it may be. Systematic saving leads
to habits of thrift and gives the per-
son dependent upon her own efforts a.
feeling of security. Furthermore, the
woman pust her first youth will do
well to pass by many dress fnds of
the hour. Fashion ts as wavering and
as changeable as an April day, and
the woman who must toll on alone
will assuredly serve her best interests
by clinging to quiet, conservative ef-
fects.—Exchange. ¢ ;

ATH Blight and Rot of Pota-
toes can be prevented by
‘spraying with Bordeaux mix-
ture, Commence’ spraying
when the plants are from Ove to
eight inches high and keep the fol-
iage covered with Bordeaux through-
out the season, Take special careto
see that the spraying is very thor-

oughly done If the weather is at all
damp about the 15th of July, as
Blight often begins about this time.
Add a poison when necessary for po-
tato beetles—arsenate of lend paste
3% Ibs. to each 40 gals. of the li-
quid spray, or Paris green 2 Ibs. to
40 gals., or a mixture of 2 lbs, arsen-
ate of lead paste and 1 1b, of Paris
green to 40 gals. From three to
seven applications should be made,
depending upon the season—the wet-
ter the weather the larger the num-
ber. Do not put off spraying because
it looks like rain. if the spray is on
tHe plants half an hour before the
rain comes it will be dry and suffl-
cient of it will stick to prevent jn-
fection, which takes place during or
soon after rain, Such spraying
should prevent not only Late Blight
and Rot but also Barly Blight and
potato beetles.

Thorough spraying only is effective,
If thorough ‘spraying is to be done
sufficient Bordeaux mixture must Dé
used. From 60 to 150 gals per acre
should be applied at each spraying,
and when the plants are large vot
less than 100 gallons per acre should
be’used. Thorough spraying means
the covering of every portion of the
potato plant with Bordeaux mixture
in the form of a fine mist. This can

“Le's go past Miss Ceell’s house! O

favver, why not?”

Ned Duncan, strofling glong quiet,
palm-bordered Marvin Street in the
cool dusk, made himself smile at the
elf that dragged on his loing fine bands
but he turned back before they reached
the corner on which way the rented
cottage of Ceellin Reeves, the woman
he loved,

Cecilia, o young mi)Jiiper who took
four college-girl roomers to help out
on her income, bent Mer yellow head
lower over her hellottyope bed as she
caught sight of his retreat, She had
meant to give them solme flowers when
they passed, She kmew he loved the
heliotrope. Had she offended him? she
wondered. :

While she puzzled, With-a burt heart.
Driscoll was saying to|himself: “I‘must
keep awny—I must mot see her any
more, The woman Ii marry roust love
my child—she miust love my little
Babs!” “

In the fourth year of Barbara's life
with him, the baby with the roguish
blick eves had come to tlhem. Then the
hext year Barbara dled, and the baby,
an elfish, whimsical, lovabile thing, had
tumbled up somehow, under his widow?
ered care, and three years of his old
cousin's somewhut crumpy housekeep-
ing and nursing,

Then the old cousin had remarried,
and he had shut up the Bungalow with
its crown of purple * blossom-covered
bougainvillea, and he and tthe child had
boarded since then, somewhat to
Babs’ disadvantage, he thought some-
fTnvee. Then e had fallem tn love with
Cecilia Reeves. tormeny

He had thought she was tthe “mother
kind” of girl (Babs ‘loved her) until
lately, Since the evening before, he
was certain she was not. Then he had
decided he couldn't ask her to marry
him. Not that he was certain she
would marry, him if he dild ask her,
but he couldn't, anyway

His landlady of the last month had
been Miss Reeves’ friend wntil Driscoll
and little Barbara came tho her board-
Ing house, and {t occurred to her that
her quiet boarder, who thad something
to do.with the management of the city
Wwatemvorks system, woulld be an Ideal
second husband. Then mfter the eve-
ning Cecilia came to take dinner with
her and-her “prize bomrder” walked
home with her, Mrs. Alkers was no

Jonger Cecil's friend. ‘

Somehow in the Jast week she had
made the Impression wn Driscoll that
Cecil didn't Nkeyehildien. He had come
home a littleearlier thin usual the
evening before and’ started to the
kitchen. -

‘T. wonder Ned kweps that child
since his wife died amd he has no one
to care for her,” he heard Cecil's soft
clear voice, “I.am goting- to try to per-
suade him to let me find o place for
her in a home!”

Driscoll felt qa though something
had struck. him.“He turned and went
upstairs. She—she didn't want dim to
keep little Babs—she cared so little
for hig baby she would persuade him
to send her'to.a home!

aThe child dropped the doll Mrs.
Akers hod bought her that day and
sprig into his arms. He kissed the
engerdittle face over and over.

“Oh, Ceci—girl—did you think that
you could persuade me to do a,fon-
sclenceleks thing like that?” fe thought
as-Babs ran do\Wwnstairsato tell, Mrs.
Akérs “fuyver” had come:

Mrs. Akers \ras already awanré of
theefact. She had henrd his step {n
the buck linll; she knew he hid heard
Cecil's last Femark.

“Was Miss Reeves here just now,
when T-caine jn?" Driscoll asked” at
dinner. “Tl thought 1 heard her:voice.”

Mrs, Akers: Fed Iips.flashed a smile.
“Oh, you convesdropper! TI hope we
Weren't Siylig anything bad. Oh, yes,
we—Cecll Was saying something about
Babs, wasn’t she?”

As Driscoll lifted the childy to” her
chair Mrs, Akers, noting his set. Ips,
felt that she had scored. Who was to
tell him thit Cecilia had been speaking:
of old Ned Mount. a destitute cripple
who persisted In kebping his tiny, or-
phaned grindchild In dirt and squalor?
Not she! ae

That” evening when the little girl

slept Drixeol] got out that other Bar-
barn’s picture, n thing he did not often
do—much as he had, Joved her—since
he had come to love Cecilin.
“The housesof the heart has many
chambers, Burbura, dear,” he said to
the picture, “and 1 wanted to put that
other girl inthe one alongside the one
in which you stay, but oh, Barbara—
Barbura—llove her! But she doesn't,
love the child—1I darenjt ask her td
come, Barbara!"

The evening after she saw Driscoll
turn nway from her gate, Cecijia went
to the theater with Lucien Glover, a
faithful admirer whom she particular-”
ly detested, and sat near Driscoll.

Driscoll, moody and, unhappy, pre-
tended interest tn the’play, but he had
but one thought. Glover had. no right
to buy her her fnvorite Richmond. roses
—he himself had done that so long!

Two weeks later came the day of the
annual rose carnival, Little Babs, wild
with éxelitethent, wént to see the pa-
rade /n the core of Mrs. Akers. That
