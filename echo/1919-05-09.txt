Born in Fort Garry (Winnipeg)
in 1852, Archbishop Matheson was
the son of one of the original Sel-
kirk settlers who left their Scottish
homes to journey via Hudson Bay to
the wilderness of the then Red River
country.

when Red Cloud and his Sioux In-

for protection after they had com-

molest the residents of Fort Garry.
The children of the fort, including
a little girl, who was afterwards the
wife of the Inte Col. James Farqu-
harson Macleod, Chief Commissioner
of the Northwest Mounted Police,
and who now resides in Calgary, and
the little lad who is now archbishop,
looked on: with horror at the revels
of the Indians, but observed their
parents’ caution to show no sign of
fear,“as that might provoke the sav-

ages to attack them.
And*yet, fifty years afterwards, in

supposedly civilized Europe, the Ger-
mans outdid these wild Indians in

ferocity!

GENERAL DEBILITY |
FOLLOWS nes

Health Can Only be Restored
¥ \

Through the Use of a Blood-

Making Tonic.

Debility is a loss of vitality
affecting any one part of the
particularly, but the system. general-
ly. It. {is dangerous because {ft re-
‘duces ithe body's: resistance to dis-
ease, When debility follow acute |
diseases, convalescence is slow, and
one’s strength does not rettirn as it
should, An‘ attack of influenza often
results in debility that persists for
months. Bverybody recognizes that
the remedy for debility is to build up
the blood, because the blood goes to
every ‘part of the body, and any im-
provemént in its condition is quickly
felt throughout 4he system.

In’ cases of simple anaemia, or de-
bility following _acute diseases. such
as feyers and influenza, Dr’ Williams’
Pink Pills will be found valuable, be-
cause they really build up the blood
and strengthen the nerves. There is
no’ other medicine as vauable for
growing clrildren, and for men and
women whose nervous energy has
been overdrawn. They are worth a
fair-trial in every case where thin
blood and weak nerves have started
the trouble, The» value of Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills has’ been proyed in
the home of Mra: John Fram, Owen
Sound, who says: “My daughter
Mabel was troubled with a bad

all that plain was covered by forests
except the marshland’ in the v@asr.
That plain, as well as Scandinavia,
peopled almost wholly -by Teutons,
was sometimes called Germania.
Bast of that line was another still
more enormous plain, Satmatia, the
home of the Slavs, d race almost un-
known. ‘ThefAlps, northern Italy, a
part of Spain, France and the British
Islands were inhabited by Celts. The
centres of the Greco-Latins were
Greece and Italy.

“Thus, at the time of Christ the
Alps are the signpost of Europe,
roughly pointing out where the races
are to be found: herth of the Alps,

body | tho Teutons; south of the Alps, the

Greao-Latins; in the Alps and ‘to the
westytho Celts; far east of the Alps,
ligfle affected by them, and therefore
little influenced by Europe and of
as- little influence in it, the Slayg
and the Finno-Ugrians.”

For Good Luck.

A newly manpried pair had escaped
from their demonstrative friends and
were on the way to the station, when
the carriage stopped. The — bridc-
greom looked out of the window im-
patiently. “What's the matter,
driver?” he called. “The horse has
tast a shoe, sir,” was the reply,
“Grent Scott!” groaned the “brdé-
groom, “even the horse!”

obtained -by having _two, three and
four grains in each wixture, It was
found that in about minety per cent.
of the experiments the mixed grains

the same grains when grown separ-
ately. Of the different combinations,
oats and barley came at the head
of the list, giving slightly over two
hundred pounds of grain per acre
more than when either one was
grown alone.

to /solve ts own peculfar problams
Liberals have’ not sought to emban
rags the Government jn connection
with #fs vemperance proposals, thelr
attitude apparently being that the
Government must “shoulder responsi.
bitty for its own legislation a8 the
Liberals undertook to do upon their
“abolish the Bar” platform in 1914, |
The granting of the right of women to |

been advocated from the Opposition
penches frgm the day the Gavernment
adopted the Liberal platform ot en.
franchisipg the ‘women, and thir
measure went through with particular
harmony. Another matter Liberals
feel they may congratulate themselves
upon is that at last the Government
has seen fit to follow the urgings ofthe

Opposition since 1914 to create a De

partment of Labor presided over by
a responsible Minister whose chief
concern will be to study and promote

Jogislative and administrative action

foy the betterment of the conditions

of the workers, of the Province. The

yovernment ‘temporized by first cre
ating a Trades and Labor Bratch u-

by announcing in the Speech from the”

s found that the |-Tyrone this year that this centlemar

would be made a Deputy Minister, and
finally by adopting the Liberal attitude

that the Labor unrest fnrustriallly and

srtage agriculturally called for die
tinct and separate consideration bys
Minister unhampered by other import
ant duties,

The Opposition during the past seq
sion has lived up to the tradiffons of j
that particular end of our constlte
tion. by constructively aiding the Gor
ernment to pass progressive laws ir
stead of indulging Im obstruction. The

for lack of a stethoscope she had to
Iny her golden-crowned little head
agninst his heart for full three min-
utes at © (Ime to find out the state
of that organ, But, anyway, there
were advantages in thfs new embar-
rassment.’ At least she was taking
him serlously—even though she re-
celved a fee for doing so—and that
was more than any’ woman had done
since the encampment was established
near Murden. She told him that he
surely did need treatment, but that
she would have’to (think the matter
over before she could preseribe,

Meantime Paul went home encour-
aged and Doctor Kate cultivated the
acquaintance ‘of Paul's sister and
mother, She had suspected something
and she found it to be true. Then she
lald out a plin for a cure and pro-
ceeded to apply ft, But the cure did
not come in any pill boxes or medicine
bottles. The first dose was an Invl-
tation to dinner at her house, on the
pretext of meeting her mother,» And
Doctor Kate watched with satisfne-
tlon that was not all professional as
he accepted-his fifth muffin—they were
made with as much wheat as the Hoo-
ver regulation allowed—and watched
him ent the dessert to make which she
and her mo6ther had foregone sugar
for two days, -Doctor Kate had a won-
derful way of tinding things out, for
Paul himself never told her about his
socks, But before’ many weeks had
passed=he was actually bringing his
socks stealthily .to Doctor Kate's
mother, who assured him she had a
perfect passion for darning, and since
her own boy had gone to the fo*nt she
had hud none to do,

Then Knte prescribed some sort of
electrical treatment for her patient
that had to be administeced every
morning In her office beforg breakfast,
find she also assured him that the good
effects-of the treatment would be off-
set If he went out afterward without
euting. Tiaving breakfast with Doc-
tor Kate and her mother therefore be-
cume part of the treatment.

And Paul recovered rapidly. He re-
gained the lost pounds, and presently
fils ease was spoken of us a feather
{n the cap of Doctor Kate Pratt... Gos-
sip had It that he was In ‘an ‘etual
decline when she took him in hand.
No one knew just what the treatment
had been, but it had required mony,
mony visits, and the fee that waa
handed over to the Red Cross us a
reault was enough to buy all the yarn
that Marden women could knit up in
a yéar.

And the funny thing was that when
Paul sued for Doctor Kate's” heart
and hand and gained them both Mar-
den women folk were a little peeved,
even to Paul’s own mother and sister.
“it’s always that< way with eligible
men,” was the comment.’ “The girls
in the home town can pet them and
pamper them for years, but the first
nice girl from out of town is the one
they marry.” ¥

Yor Marden failed to see: how. piti-
fully susceptible Paul Dedham had be |
come 18 a result of the neglect he had
suffered,

ALL HAVE DREADED GHOSTS

Spirits Play a Most Important Part In
the Lives of Primitive Peoples
of the World.

Ghosts are extremely ancient. The
people of old who dwelt In cives were
well acquainted “with them.

In the Wives of primitive peoples of
today a very Iniportant partis played
by ghosts... Thetr worlds thickly
populuted. with them. When a man
phantasm, which cannot
Sleep, goes abtrnveling.

With this phontasm he Is quite fa-
milinr, because It visibly attends him
in the daytime. Jt fs lils shadow, Say,
ages are usually mare or Jess afmid
of shadows. :

TS the suvage, not only amimate bur
even inanimate things have their
ghosts. Céncealed within every objéct
(sa mystery—ii noumenon lurking be-
hind=the phenomenon, as_a psyeholo-
gist would express the Idea. In any
cock there is flreshidden. ~ One hrs
only to strike it with another pleee of
cock and sparks fly. :

Among the most appalling spooks
that haunt the Iroquois ts a earnivor-
ous ghost that feeds on men. Echo,
in thelr bellef, Is a phantom that re-
Dents ffielr words mockingly among

certain huge heads; without. bodies,
that go flying about. 1

Where Americans Lead. ®

The American is fascinnted by novel
problems, by ungauged and Ungauge_

enuse Europe had never ventured to
build skyscrapers that.is no renson
‘why a Woolworth should-not rear n
structure more than 50 storfes In. the
air. For centuries man had dreamed
of flying, but without success; yet
two obscure American Inds, nothing
daunted, experimented until they con-
quered the alr... The original McCor-
Inick was n farmer, not a mechanic,
but-that did not deter him from mak-

give up until he had made both no

with the muntoipality by,means of a

so ti¥t the work of the Board of Trade
may not be interrupted from year to
yeur by changes in the personnel of
the Gouncil. Then we. must have co-
operation among’ officers, members
and: citizens. Memberspwho do not
put forth every effort along helpful
and constructive lines are no good.
Much work will.have to be carried on
by special committees” who. stay on
the job. and bring projects’ to a suc-
cessful conclusion. He outlined the
work of the publicity committee, and
the problems confronting the Trans-
portation Committee, the latter of
which, will have to deal with the ques-
tiorof bringing the Essex Terminal
to. Amherstburg He warned the
Board when this Is done to see that
freight terminals are built with a view
to the future growth of*the town. Re.
garding the future ownership. of the
S..)W. & A. eletcric railway, when the
combination is formed to take over
the railway, Amherstburg should see
that it should have its just share of
the “partnership, “Mr. Héaley also

“Forget three things,” said Mr.

LACKLEG of potatoes [5 a dis-
ease that has be?n causing
heavy losses to polto grow-
ers in many districts during
the pnst few. years, As the name of
the disease implies, there 18 2 black-
ening of the lower parts of stems cf
the potato plant affected, Accom-
panying the discoloration there is a
soft rotting condition followed by
Shrinkage and death.
“The disease is usually first noticed
in the young growing crop when the
plants are from four inches to a foot
high,” In looking oveta fleld in
which the disease Iq present, it will
be seen that the topsrof certitin plants
have lost their bright dark green
appearance, haying faded to a more
or less dirty yellowish or brownish
color. These tops will be somewhat:
limp and drooping, and in some cases
where the disease is‘ well advanced
will have dropped right over. [fa
careful examination of the lower
stems of these affected plants is made
it will be seen that they are black-
ened and soft rotting, This black-
ening and soft rotting is more
noticeable below the soil than above
it. By carefully removing the sofl
from “around an affected plant the
blackening and soft-rotting can us-
ually be traced to the seed tuber, As
a rule in such cases the seed tuber
will be found to be in a soft-rotting,
slimy condition,.the soll immediately
beneath’ it being in a Wet, puddled
condition due to the wetness from the
soft-rotted seed tuber, In such cages
the disease in the plant has developed
from an affected seed tuber and pass-
ed up the young growing stems, ecays-
ing them to discolor and rot and
eventually to fall over dead or dying.
