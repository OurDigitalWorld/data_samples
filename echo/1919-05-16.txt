The Easiest Way
To Invest —

Canada, following the example of other
Allied countries, has made it possible
for wage earners—men and women—
to invest in safe securities without effort.

These securities are called War Savings
Stamps.

The cost now $4.04, but by compound-
ing interest, the $4.04 you invest now
will be worth $5.00 in 1924. There is
no other security in which you can in-
vest such a small amount that is as safe

in May
and that bears so high a rate of interest.

W-s.s.

Cost $4.04 a
Or you can start with 25 cents, by buy~

ing a Thrift Stamp. When you have
sixteen Thrift Stamps, you can exchange
them for a War Savings Stamp.

In June
W-ss.

Cost 3,95

You take no risks. The Government

of Canada guarantees to pay you back
your money — with interest — at any
time during the five years, or to pay you
in 1924 $5.00 for every $4.00 (and a
fraction) you invest now. 2

Make Your Savings Serve You and
Serve Your Country—Invest Them in
War Savings Stamps.

“There are briliant discoveries to be

However, ths aspiring vyolcanolog-
iat must, we barn, be in possession
of certain atributes before he can
hope to attsn success. These are
“an aptitude for scientific research,
the. physique to endure rough moun-

taineering amd the courage to. face
the risk of bang’ engulfed in the fiery,
lava,”

Touching won the general lack of
knowledgé. “hh regard to volcanoes
Mr. Frazer says; “Our grandfathers
knew a gret deal more about vol-
Ganoes than we do, but what they
knew .was early all wrong, They
declared thute the inteplor of the
globe was # ‘molten miss,” It is
almost certsinly a dense solid, more
rigid than steel.” And the facts
which prove this, he says, are “its
weight (as determined by astrono-
mers), tte way it transmits earth-
quake waves, the resistance it offers
to the distorting effect of the sun’s
and the moon’s attraction, ete, But
the interior of the earth, as far as
we can determine, is.so intensely hot
that if at any place far below the sur-
face the stupendous crushing force
of:the rocks above is, by any means,
somewhat reduced, the solid must
change to a liquid, or even a gas.”’

Improvements In Steel Making.

Amongst war-time research work
the benefit of which will be perman-
ent better, control of the heat treat;
ment of steel! promises valuable re-
sults. It is now widely recognized
that comparatively few degrees vari-
ation In the temperature makes all
the difference in the properties of the
finished material: The difficulties
are particularly great where large
masses of steel’ dye concerned, be-
cause it [8 dificult to secure the same
temperature at the surface and in
the mass of the metal. Other’ dim-
culties are Mitroduced by the differ-
ent scaling (endencies and different
emissivities of various steels. Recent
improvements in furnace construc-
tion facilitate the attainment of unl-
form temperatures, and the means
and methods of pyrometry have been
developed to such an extent that the
most delicate heat instrument can be |
given with almost mathematical cer-
tainty and on the basis of a com-
mercial repetition process. It was
suggested recently by*Dr. Carpenter,
at Sheffield, ¢ working tempera-
tures would be Inid down in. speciQ--
cations for steel products in the near
future. A start has already been
made and the state of practice” is
such that ‘this: policy is sure to be
extended. + #5 . 4

Does a F armer

IHE farmer with a Ford Truck
practically lives next door to
the market.

He has a choice of markets.
He becomes more independent.

He can market his goods when
and where he pleases.

He sells his crop to the very best
advantage.

And his hauling costs him less—
in labor and money.

It is not only cheaper to haul
with a Ford Truck than with a
team and wagon, it is quicker, it is
easier work.

Consider the time and labor the
7 farmer ean save with a Ford Truck.
With a team the trip to town takes

the better part of a day.

new Parliament Buildings.

A con-
fg art critics, artists, architects,
selptors and laymen,

Trtroubls is over the gargoyles
on the>pildings. The buildings are

goyles, both fy and out, fom natur-
ally a prominént feature of the de-
corations, Many ofthe gnpaayles in-
stead of being grof#4ue Animals and

prominent Canadan statesmen and
/Public men,

The controvery Started through a
paper read at tle recent meeting of

the Ottawa Tachers’ Institute by
A. FB, Newlaris, artist for the Ot-
tawa schools, inwhich he condemned
in scathing Ianjuage the idea of gro-
fesque caricatues of public men as
decorations for all time on the! Par-
Hament Buildings: Mr. Newlands de-
seribed the gawoyles depicting Sir
Robert Borden, Sir Wilfrid Laurier,
the Duke of jevonshire, the Duke
of Connaught, ton, William Pugsley
and other celemittes as “disgusting
jokes,” We ha been supported by
BE. .G. Fosbery, A.R.C.A., an Ottawa
artist, who dosiribes them as ‘‘mud-
pie faces: <a

John Penrsof the chief architect
for the building has kept out of the
controversy, except to point out that
the designs wer? approved by a com-
mittee of leadme Canadian artists.
He has been gipported in his con-
tention that they are in keeping with
Gothic arcHitecwre by a number of
leading Ottawa artists and sculptors.
It is pointeg.out that many old-world
churches in their gargoyles have even
caricatured leading ecclesiastics,
(The soulptor responsible for the
work is~ a Widely-known English
artist, Walter J. Allen. He worked
on Durham, Salisbury and Win-
chester Cathedrals. Several years he
spent abroad siwdying the French,
German and’ Spaaish Gothic archi-
tecture, He has for years been look-
ed upon as an authority in England
on Gothic architecture.

Some of the gargoyles are so gro-
tesque that the caricatures are
searcely recognizatie, This is not
true of the heads representing the
Dukes of Connaught and Devonshire.
They adorn the corner of windows
outside the Senate block. The Duke
of Connaught’s nose is, perhaps, a

little @xaggerated and the some is
true of the moustache of the Duke
of Devonshire. Both express humor
and there is nething offensive about
the gargoyles. ~The gargoyles repre-
senting Sir. Robert Borden, Sir Wil-
frid Laurier, Sir’ John. A, Macdonald
and Hon. Alex. Mackenzie are all
easily recognizable.

One of the most amusing of the
figureS’ is one, the Inspiration for
which is drawn from Hon. BH, N.
Rhodes, Speaker of the House...He
has a great beak of a noge add has
an open eye turned to the Govern-
ment benches and a blind cye to the
Opposition. Another “amusing gar-
goyle is that of Hon. William Pugs-
ley, who Is depicted smoking a, pipe,
probably from his frequent summing
up. ef a controversy with an oppon-
ent by-the remark, “take that and
smoke it,’*

In addition to leading statesmen
who have been caricatured on the
new buildings there are many less
Prominent mén who’ have furnished
inspiration for the artist, . On the
window on the extreme northeast of
the. building is a figure which repre-
sénts theelate Alonzo Wright, M.P.,
who was the pioneer of the Gatineau
country and was known as “the King
of the Gatineau.”
gazing<up towards the Gatineau riv-
er, where for years in) his splendid
home he entertained Dike a prince.

Col. Ernest Chambers, Gentieman

Our Power.

Canada is" well known to have
gone energetically about the utiliz-
ation of water power, but it will sur-
prise many people to learm that a
census of hydro-eléctric developments
in the Dominion shows a total of
2,305,310 turbine horsepower de-
veloped. Unless methods of compu-
tation have differed radically from
those ustally employed, Canada has
developed nearly half as much water
power as the United States. The esti-
mate for the United States was plac-

ed in a recent scléntifie bulletin for

the Government at roughly one-tenth
the amount which could: be utilized
without special storage provision, or
5,000,000 horsepower. The Cana-
dian census shows about 1,750,000
horsepower developed in central
electric stations, and most of the rest
in pulp and paptr manufacturies.
Ontario and Quebse ‘are: furnishing
more than two-thirds the total: Only
Norwoy uses more water power per

—Increased $235,000,000 Since
the Beginning of The War.

 

   

Supplementary
fiscal year ended Marchi 31st, 1919,
were tabled fn the House at Ottwwa on
Muay 7th. They total $18,827,008.

The net debt of the country, Sir
Thomas White stated, was now $%1,-
584,000,000. Prior to the war {t was
$235,000.000, so that the Increase in
the national debt was $1,384,000,000.
The war loans outstanding amounted
to $1,506,276,922, and the account with
the Imperial Government showed a
difference of $200,000,000 to the credit
of Canada. He gave the following
statement of war costs in summarized
form: 1914-16, $60,750.000; 1915-16,
$166,000,000; 1916-17, .$206,000,000;
1917-18, $243,000,000; 1918-19 (estim-
ated maximum), $450,000.000.
$350,000,000 for Demobilization,
The bill to provide -$360,000,000 for
demobilization and other purposes
arising out-of the war was considered
by the committee. -Mr. McKenzie sug-
gested that ft should not have been
brought before the House until after
the budget speech, and he therefore
thought that before proceeding to ex-
amine in detail the provisions of the
bill, the Minister of Finance should
present a statement of war costs;

Sir Thomas White replied that he
did not regard itis necessary that the
consideration of the bill should await
the bringing down of the budget. The
budget showed the revenue received
during the past year and indicated the
amount expected during the coming
year, together with proposals regard-

   
  
   
   
 
 
  

    
 

  
 

   

    
    

pénditures, However, he said that
when he presented the budget he
would mae as accurate a statement

is possible ag to the total cost of the
war from the beginning, as well as an

éstimated cost of pensions and other
matters which the war had entailed.

NE mere foreign name does-
n't matter, so we have little

compunction in presenting
to our readers Dr. Karel
Kramarzh. He js a great man in his

own country, and now as chief repre-
sentative of the Czecho-Slovaks at
Paris may be destined to play an im-
portant rol@7in the dispositfon of
some of the most acute of the prob-
lems to be settled there, ond par-
ticularly the dispute with Italy, The
doctor is Prime Minister of the
Czecho-Slovak republic, and has had
a long and adventurous career’ in
Austrian politic#. ¢ Twice since the
war began he has narrowly iescaped
death, once by sentence of a court-
martial, and again from an assassin.
The correspondent of the London
Times who previously represented his
paper at Vienna recently met, the
Prime Minister in Paris and heard
the story of his adventures, In days

before the war the two men were
well acquainted, and the correspon-
dent says that the speeches Dr. Kra-
marzh used to deliver in the Austrian
Parliament were probably the best
heard there for years, In those 5

THE PORUGUESE,

 

Kepresion,

{ously spasmodic and uneven course
of its subsequent growli, was, in {t-
felf, as progressive and prosprnus a
period. in the history of the cointry
as was the period of the Roman weu-
pation, George Young writes in

| Portugal: As Historical Stuly.”

“The Ommeyad Caliphs were enlizht-

ened rulers who tolerated the munt-
| cipal and ecclesiastical institudons

that they found existing in the oun-
try, and greatly improved both the
conditions of life and such culure
a8 was possible in those days, The
Arab words left in the language siow

clearly enough the scope of. thelr |

Activities; and the main industries of
the country, especially that of agri-
culture, have vocabularies that ure
still largely Afabic,’’

“There was, indeed, a8 much geod
to be said for the Ommeyad rule in
the Iberian Peninsula as for the ear-
ly Ottoman Tule in th® Balkan Penin-
sula, Such foretgn rule did not »e-
come wholly evil until the Inevitable
renaissance of the subjected western
nationality,-and the equally ineyit-
able decadence of the eastern rujiog
race, brought on In either land the
long-drawn-out dissolution of the
eastern domination. This dissolution
began in Portugal toward the end
of the-tenth century with the decline
of the Ommeyad Caliphate: and
thereafter, for a time, the history of
the peninsula ®ecame one of small
wars between the Moorish. emirs of
the .Algarves and Beira, and the
Christian nobles of Galicia and As-
turias. This was thé period of the
Cid and of the Crusades,sthe school
in which the future Porta se chiv-
alry was bred; and many of the
ideals of Portuguese nationality date
back to this dark age. But the IHb-
eration of the land was nol yet due;
and the unification of the Christians
had, as a first result, the regonsolida-
tion of the Moorish factions. The
rise of a strong central power, the

 

 

  
  

 

] Almoravidee. Caliphate,. gave new

life to Moorish rule; so that the war
betweqn Christian and Moor ebbed
and) flowed cont{hually from the
Douro to. the Tagus, Meantime, the
people of Portugal, the. raw material
of the new nation, lay-like a flooded
land awash under this-welter of. war-
ring creeds, waiting until the tide of
time should free them from thé As{a-
tie flood; for the ebb and flow of the
Moorish flood had broken up and
beaten down into one solid -soclety
the Iberlan, Celtic, Roman and Visi-
gothic elements composing the new
nation. The Portuguese state, unlike
other West European mations, but
like many. Central and t Euro-
pean nations, was mainly the product

  
  

    

au

“of wars of race and religion; and

we) may say, perhaps consider, that
Portugal, toward jhe end of the
Moorish wars, hadealready acquired
a nationality. Bit it had as yet no
name, and was without any sufficient
territorial holding.

_./‘Late in the Moorish wars we first
find the name of the country as that
of a northern feudal, province, the
county of Portugal, so called because
it*contained the Portus Cale of the
Romans—our Oporto: With the his-
tory of this province the political his-
tory of Portugal begins.

‘It is a truth, though a much dis+
puted*one, that war, can create noth+
ing; and those who attribute the
birth of Portugal-as a’ nation wholly
to the wars against the Moors are 45
far astray as those more enthusiastic
nationalists who find its birtn in the
skirmishes of+/Viriatho’ againet- the
Romans. But) where the expression

Ac New Fuel.

Little short of,a complete revolu-
{fon in the ¢onl business and, conse-
quently, far-reaching changes in in-
dustry are the results which, it is
predicted, will follow from the in-
vention of a new commercial process
of converting bitu ous coal initio

fuel is entircly smokeldss, and

People.

continent was peopled by intelligent
communities,

In the last century a great‘ deal

was learned abopt this dark conti-
nent, and the South African company
did much to add to the store of

knowledge,

The expedition of this company in-
to’ Mashonaland, in search of gold,
passed the wonderful ruins of Zim-
baye, nearly 200 miles due west of
Sofala, on the Indian Ocean,

They have been attributed to the
Moors, the Phoenie¢ians and the Per-
sians, and it is said by the old
chroniclers that there were Ingcrip-
tions, which modern archeologists
have set out to decipher.

These structures were reared of
Branite, hewn into small blocks, a
little larger than a brick, and put
together with mortar. In all the
walls are seen two or three courzes
of masonry, where the granite
blocks are inserted in zigzag fashion.

There seems to be no doubt that
they were erected. as Places of de-
fence, and also for the smelting,
storing and protecting of gold, cop-
per, and other: metals.

On removing a quantity of the sur-
face rubbish inside there were found
what was evidently tnree large cir-
cular roasting floors, formed of
burnt fireclay and slightly concave.
There were also remains of slag and
other evidences that the place had
been used for smelting metals,

It is certain that the last thing
eivilized men would expect to find in
this region, where the natives belong
to the lower stages of human de
velopment, are these great rock struc-
tures betokening the existence of a
former civilization amid these wilds.

The natives have not even any
tradition as to the origin of the
ruins. There are many facts prov-
ing their great antiquity, and among
them the circumstances that at one
of the-great ruins at Zambaye an
jronwood. tree, which was undoubt-
edly hundreds of years old, had-risen
through the wall and split {t.

 

He Was Right. *

Senor Costa, the Portuguese Prime
Minister, in excusing himself from
making a speech on the ground that
he was no orator, told an amusing
anecdote at a luncheon p&rty given in
his honor during his recent visit to
London, It appears that when first
put up fof the Portuguese National
Council he prefaced his opening ad-
dress to the electors’ by alluding
frankly to his lack of. oratorical
gifts. After he had finished a man
Pushed forward, gfasped his hand
warmly, and said: “Senor, I’ve been
a lifelong opponent of yours, but at
the coming election I shall vote for
you.” “Thank. you,” replied Costa,
much gratified. “May I ask the par-
titular reason forwyour change of
views?”” “Because you are the first
speaker on elther side that I have
heard tell the truth,” was the réply.
“You said when you began that you
couldn't make much ofa speech, and
by heavens, senor, you can’t.”

It has two decks and {is heated by a

permits eontinuous baking. twenty-
