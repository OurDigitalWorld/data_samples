BASEBALL.

 

Brunner, Mond teams have not been
maintaining a regular schedule by
refpons of rain and. working over-
time, but several important games
have been pulled off. On Wednesday,
July 8th, the Engineers’ fast team de-
feated the Machinists 10 to-9. The
Machinists tagged along behind from
the start, but tied the score their-half
of the 7th when they started a great
batting rally, getting in five- runs.
Buck Morin made a dandy catch off
Hanna's hot liner with two on bases
and two out. Capt. Tyler opaned the
Engineer's half of the 7th with a sin-
gle to right fleld, stole second and
third base and walked home with the
winning run’on o passed ball. The
winning of this game tied the Bngin-
eers and Machinists for first place,
and the standing to date js as follows:

Won Lost p.c.

PEMBineers 4. ne. rer ees 6 8—625
| Machinists .,......... 5 8—625
Riveters 3 4 2

  

On July 12th the game between the
Engineers and Riveters was postpon-
ed on account of rain. On April 16th |
the Riveters and Machinists played a
tle game, 10 to 10. On July 18th, the |
Engineers—Riveters game was_ posf-
poned, ajl working overtimé. From
present appearances the Engineers
are going to cop the pennant, and that
lovely smile that lit up the face of
Manager Kimber has entirely digip-
| beared and he seems {Oo have develop-
}ed a chronic grouch against the whole
| world.

A snappy game was played Satur-
day evening between the Windeor fast
team and the Amherstburg Regulars.

of a possible lover somewhat dampened

enjoying some grent: joke. Reeves
groped In his mind vainly to find some
solation to this extraordinary circum:
stance. He fancied the moment had
come to reveal himself. He had taken
the slipper from his case. He pene-
trated the hedge with the slipper in his
hand.

“Pardon me,” he said, “but I think
this lost property Is yours.”

Norman Edgeworth came to a quick
halt. She stared blankly at the in-
truder. Then her quick mind worked
out the problems of the moment.

“Yes,” she sald, flushing Slightly.
“You are the gentleman who offered

“It struck me there,” observed
Reeves craftily, exposing the nobraston

“T aay |”

Reeves Darlow, lolling.against a tree
trunk a few feet beyond a high stone
wall, his sketching outfit lying neglect-
ed at his side, uttered the ejaculation
sharply and eat up.

His hand sought a certain spot on
hig forehead, with which suddenly, un-
expectedly some flying object had come

fpptact. The blow had been a sharp

roke the skin and evidenced tho
flity of a rising lump. He won-
what had struck him, and why.
Tien he recalled the sound of merry
girlish voices beyond the wall. ‘

“Something thrown—of course not
purposely,” he soliloquized, “Ah!
there's the missile—a slipper,”

As he arose he obsetved the object
in question. It Iny on the grass, white,
small, high-heeled, dainty. He turned
it over and over fa-his hand, somewhat
admiringly. Then he roused nt the echo
of a rustling sound. Where a portion
of the wnll was gone and there was n
breach like a gatewny, a graceful femi-
nine figure had appeared. One foot
was slipperless, Here was the owner
of the innocent missile,

About to advance and tender the
slipper, Darlow was a good deal disap-
pointed as its owner uttered’ a screnm
and, turning, flashed back out of view |
ike # nimble sprite. A great hubbub
arose beyond the wall,

“What scared you Norma—a bear?”
cried out an animated wolce,

“Worse thin that.”

“A horrid man?”

“A man, but not particularly horrid.
Rather: distinguished looking, I judge,
trom the fleeting glance I got. But oh!
me Ilmping on my stockingéd foot!
Quick, Melba, grab the ball and let us
vanish.”

There were mock exclamations of
fright and dismay. Darlow reached
the wall and waved tbe slipper over It,
but, scurrylig from the field, a group
of half. a-dozen girls paid not the
slightest “attention; while with a
shocked expression of face the denuded
one, she who had lost the slipper, ran
the fastest, her white sitk-covered foot
gleaming in and out of the grass entire-
ly fascinating in its nimbleness and
gracefulness of form.

“H'm 1!” observed Darlow, “she must
have footgear galore to disdain the re-
turn of the ellpper, I see, a beyy of
girls playing at football, n wild kick,
and hence the slipper. And my bump!”
and »Darlow ‘ruefully rubbed the
nbralsed spot. “As to the slipper,-I'll
keep {t a8 a memento. It may suggest
fn romanti¢,pencil sketch, or a story.”

He thréw the pretty sotin-bowed
trifle into his sketcliing case, closed it
and pursued his way... Reeyes Darlow's
way just now was the’ way of an idle
stroller off on 4 hit-or-miss jaunt, “He
forgot _dbout the slipper. by morning.
Its owner ceased to fill his thoughts
before the close of the day following. —

Meantime, she of the- lost slipper,
Norma Edgeworth, and lier breathless
agsociates clenred the fleld-and settled
down to rational progress;

“It's a pity to leave that slipper be
hind, Norma,” spoke one of her com-
pnnions, :

“Oh, you know I'm bound yith the
morning for an environment where sat-
fo siippers and the Iike will be a neg-
ligitile quantity.”

“Surely you have got that foolish
scheme of yours out of your head,
dear?”

“Never !" “dissented Norma with
vigor, “It isn’t a scheme, it’s n test,”

“And you are ‘bound to go through
with {t?”

“Barring the possibility of some of
‘ou chatterers betraying the fiction.”

“Oh, we'll:be true blue, Norma!” pro-
claimed an urgent chorus,

—we forget our losses, we adhere to our first
plan of action, that of always bestowing upon
our customers the opportunity: to save money,
