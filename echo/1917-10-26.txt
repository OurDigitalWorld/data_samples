—A friendly mathematician has fig-

personal income from the pork pack-

triflé over $16 an hour, or 25 cents a
minute, awake’ and asleep, night and
day, Sundays and week days. Fig:

his wage was $53 an hour. This fs
not a bad income for any one man

sum to Canada. That is about all the
people have received from Sir Joseph's
title, for which they have been taxed
so much.

should do so in the province in which
he resides. It fs explained, however,
that the’ term “resides” js not “Intend-

Proportion of men-{n Class 1 of the

than reporting for service under its

however, that where those seeking ex-

Loiselleville. ‘

The Parish of Loiselleville, one of
our good French-Canadian parishes,
of the diocese of London, was ‘céle-
brating Sunday and.Monday, October
14th and 15th, o double anniversary
very: joyous for ali—the 50th annivers-
ary of the birth of their pastor, Rev.
J. A. Loilselle, and his 25th annivers-
ary of the priesthood, . The parishion;
ers of LoiseHeville and the Frencli-
Canadians of the other parishes 6f the
county would have» been anxious to
make at this oceasion a pageant day

in demonstration’ and festivities, but

the two tombs, of Fathers St. Cyr And
Beaudoin of regretted memory, are
not yet closed enough, and the cir-
cumstances too tragic to let them-
selves go at great rejoicing,» Never:
theless the pnrishionets of Loiselle-
ville did not want these two great
events to pass without giving to the
brave jubilarian a tangible. proof of
gratitude for all be has done for them,
Miss Clara Gauthier, the organist, al-
ways devoted to the temporal, welfare
of the church, organized for that day
a splendid program, which was exe-
cuted with: complete success in the
auditorium of the imposing parochial
church. As all was.to be done in the
greatest\intimacy, In family we might
gay, no inyitation was sent, and only
few intimate friends among the neigh-
bors came to join In the celebration.
The parishioners took occasion of the
first represention -on Sunday to ex-
press their-gratitude and present their
good wishes, An addres was read by
Ernest Bondy. accompanied by a
well-filled purse, The drama “Therese
la Fratricide” owas executed with
such §redt suctess by the local tal-
ent that its” repetition on Monday
night brought a great nomber of
strangers.from Windsor, Walkerville,
Sandwich and Amherstburg. Appro-
priate speeches were made and all the
young ladies wito took part in the
drama received their well deserved
share of felicitations. All those who
assisted at those quiet but touching
celebrations will long keep in their
hearts a consoling remembrance.
Father Loldelle, although caught by
surprisé, unfiwaore that the drama was
to be played nt he occasion of this
double anniversary, answered in’ a
jovial manner, but hia remarks caused
many tears. Through The Echo once
more we, the parishioners of Lojselle,
ville, wislft6 extend to our esteemed
pastor onr sentiments of gratitude,
and we ‘pray that God will spare him
many years yet among us. May he
enjoy a little rest and comfort after
his eight years of arduous work in
the parish. .The splendid Studebaker
roadster, which replaced the old Over-
land in his garage, will give him an
opportunity to do so. We want you
to enjoy it—The wedding bells rang

Why Canada
More Money

UP to date the war has cost Canada about $700,000,000.
Canada has spent in Canada over $400,000,000 on her own account.
Canada has spent in Canada on behalf of Great Britain over $300,000,000.

What Canada spends for-Great Britain is really loaned to Great Britain
and will be repaid or credited to Canada later on. \

Great Britain needs so much ready
cash to finance her own expenditures at
home for herself and for our Allies that she
must buy on credit from Canada, and from
every other country where she can get
credit.

Of course Great Britain’s credit is so
good that other countries, in order to get her
trade, are quite,as willing to give her credit
as we are in Canada.

Canada wants to help Great Britain
not only because Canada wants Britain's
trade but because we are Canada and she is
Great Britain—both members of the ‘same
great Empire, kin of our kin, our mother-
land.

For Canada it is both a ‘filial, and
patriotic duty to supply Great Britain’s
war needs and remember, her needs are our
needs. Also it is in Canada's self-interest
to supply those needs and thus keep open
a market for our products.

* * *

Now, Britain needs our ,wheat, our
cheese, cattle, hogs, and many manufac-
tured articles. ~ =

Caxiada also needs many of these things
+-beiween the two it amounts to more
than a inillion dollars a day in cash.

And the producers must be paid in
cash, a
Neither Canada nor Great Britain

“could go.{o a Canadian farmer and buy

his wheat or his cattle on credit.”
The farmer and all other producers

. might- be ever so willing to“ give their
“country credit but they could not do it

because they have to pay cash for wages,

for rent, materials, etc. They must be paid
in cash, or its equivalent. +

So Canada says to Great Britain:—“T
will lend you the money so that you can
‘pay cash to Canada’s producers for what
“you want.

“J will borrow this money from our
own people just as you borrow money from
your people.

“J will also borrow from the people of
Canada money to pay cash for all the pro-
ducts that Canada, as well as Great Britain,

needs in Canada.” 2

That is Canada’s practical, patriotic
part in helping to win the war.

Without this credit the Canadian pro-
ducer could not sell to“Great Britain, and
without these Canadian products the war
would be prolonged.

_ So it is necessary for Canada to giv?
to Great Britain the credit inorder that
Canada’s own producers, who need arnarket,
will have one; and in order that Great
Britain which needs the products to win the
war, will get them.

hk a

Now how does Canada get the money
by which both Canada and Britain can pay
cash for Canada’s products?

By borrowing it from the people of
Canada ‘through the sale»'6f Canada's
Victory Bonds to be@ffered in November.

‘That is why Canada’s Victory Bonds
are offered to the people—to raise money
to help to finish the war. oa lat 4 gy

“Canada must keep her shoulder to the
wheel even though it be a chariot of fire,”
and the way for Canada to keep her
shoulder to the wheel is by buying

Friday, October 26, 1917.

Ontario Liberals did not. choose
successor to Hon. Newton Wesley
Rowell as leader of the Opposition in
the Legislature, at their meeting in
Toronto’ Saturday afternoon, but they
passed o resolution expressing their
determination to continue the fight
for the progressive policies advocated

 

Mittee of seven to decide on the mode
of procedure in connection with the
appointment of a provincial leader
and to’ formulate the program of bus!
ness to be brought, before the ad-
journed meeting to be held within-the
next thirty days. Stewart.Lyon, editor
of the Globe, and J. E. Atkinson, pub-
Usher of the Star, are both prominent-
ly mentioned in connection with the
vacant leadership,

A very dnteresing investigation into
the cost of producing milk is in pro-
gress at Ottawa. At Friday: morn;

W. C. Kennedy, Liberal Nominae. — |

With tho adoption of a resolution,
moved by Wm. Grant, of Walkerville,
and James Hedrick, of Rochester,
concurring in the plan suggested by
North Essex Conservatives regording
the. selection’ of a fusion Parliament-
ary candidate, North Bsasex Liberals
at Windsor, Saturday afternoon vir-
tually accepted the olive branch ex-
tended to them a week ago, and nam-
ed a strong committee to confer with
the executive of the Conservative or-
ganizetion on the question. The com-
Tittee is made up of Gordon M. Mc-
Gregor, Managing Director of the
Ford Motor Company of Cannda; Alex-
ander R. Bartlet, barrister; W. EB.
Gundy, real estate dealer; James An-
derson, General Manager Windsor
Street Rallway Company; Maurice
Renaud, capitalist, and Severin Du-
charme, M.P.P.

Following the discussion of the
selection of n “win-the-war” candi-
date, tha’ gathering unanimously en-
dorsed William C. Kennedy, of Wind-
sor, a8 the Liberal nominee for the
constituency.

Mr. Kennedy's name was proposed
by Severin Ducharme, M.P.P., and Dr.
P. A. Dewar, and was connected with
a Tesolution which, after ratifying his
candidacy, fnstructed Mr, Kennedy to
“pursue a thoroughly independent
course in Parliament, if elected, no
matter what government may be in
power, supporting only such meas-
ures as he considered will best assist
the Empire in a successful prosecu-
tion of the war.”

Mr. Kennedy, who on rising was
given hearty-applause, said, in part:

“There have been differences of
opinion with regard to the Military
Service Act. Many Liberals, as well
as Conservatives, have’ held the view
that a Union Government should haye
been arranged two years ago and that
enforcement of selective conscription
of men and of wealth would haya
much better conserved our man-power
and taken to the front the classes of
men best adapted for service in place

with large families; involving great
economic waste invproviding for their
dependents, while leaving young, phy-
sical fit, unmarrled*men walking .the
streets or drawing. large wages.
Pledges Support to Selective Draft.
“The fact remains, However’ that
Liberals and, Conservatives alike,
without distinction of politics or oth-
éerwise, have sgeérificed their lives,
and what is often much hardér, the
lives of their sons in this” great na-
tional effort to win the war, and
Whatever differences of opinion may
have existed heretofore the military
service act has been passed and be-
come law, and it js our unequivocal
duty to obey it. I will, if elected,

crop of tobacco ever grown by one
man in the counties of Essex and

BLOOD - MAKING MEDICINE

It took centuries for medical science
to discover that the blood is the life.
Now, it is known that if the blood
were always abundant, rich, and pure,
very few people would ever be ill.
It was not until the end of the 19th
century that an instrument was in-
vented for mensuring the red part of
the blood. Then doctors could tell
how anaemic a pationt had become,
and with medicine to make new blood
the patient soon got well. ¥

All the blood in the body {s‘nourish-
ed and kept rich and red by the food
taken daily, but when, for any reason,
& person is run down and cannot make
sufficient blood from the food to keep
the body in health then a blood-mak-
Ing medicine is required. The sim-
plest and very best of blood-makers
suitable for home use by anyone, is
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, When a

‘good effect Is soon shown js an jim-

proved appetite» stronger nerves, a
sound digestion and an ability to mas-
ter your work and enjoy leisure hours.
For women there is a prompt relief
of, or prevention of ailmenta which
make life a burden. As an all-round
medicine for ,the cure of ailments
due to weak, watery blood no medi-
cine discovered by medical science
can equal Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
You can get thesé pills through ‘any

S. E. TEACHERS’ CONVENTION.

The teachers of South Essex Inspec-
torate held their annual convention
{in the town hall, Exsex, on Thursday
and Friday of Jast wéek. Inspector
Maxwell occupied the chair during the
day session. Owing .to favorable
Weather, the atendance was large—
ono hundred and forty-eight answer-
ing to their namés on Thursday.

County teachers contributed the
major part of thesprogram with ‘sin-
gular credit to themselves: Miss
Willey, of Leamington, spoke on
“Number Work,” P. McCallum dis-
cussed “Subtraction,” Mfss Grant, of
Gesto, gave her'experiences of “Ways
and Means of teaching Agriculture,”
Miss Wyman dealt with “Art in the
Public: School.” All of these topics
merited” fuller discussion than time
would permit.

Graduate of the Toronto and
Guelph Summer Schools spoke highly
of the profitable supplementary
courses takén there during’ the holl-
days and ured teachers to take ad-
vantage of these?courses in larger
numbers,

The High schools-of the county
Were-represented on the program by
Mr.) Masey and Misg 2B: Wilson. The
formor “discussed “When to Enter
High School,” while the latter took up
“Esgontial Points in Reading” From
records of the local High School, Mr.
Massey demonstrated that few. pupils
entering the High school over thirteen
years take the full High School course
while the majority of that age or leas
"take up the entire course—not o faw
solng on to the higher, school of Jearn-
mg. fa
_G, A. Hoffard, M.A., of Lonilou Nor-
mal school, gave very interesting lec-
tures on “Hygiene” and “Nature
Study.” He urged the teaching of
practical’ hygiene, and stressed . the

[economic aspect of nature atudy.

, The public meeting in the town hall
was- considered one of the best night
sessions held for some time; Mayor
Gay, a former toacher, occupied the
Keceptance. ~~

Mr. Damude, principal of Leaming-
|ton Public school delighted the :aud-
fence with two readings. Istrument-

BAD YEAR FOR CANNERS. |New’ PENSION FORMS

Only five per cent. of.the usual
quantity of corn, only 10 per cent. of
the tomatoes.and 12 per cent. of the
greén beans canned in a normal year
have been secured by the canning
factories ‘this year and the supply of
canned végetables, the Government
embargo on which expired Tuesday, is
reported to be the worst in years and
so bad that there’ will be little ap-
preciable “effect on the trade through
the rémoval of the embargo. A pram-
Inent wholesale grocer saya:, “This
hos beenga very bad yenr for vege-
tables. Our last report showed that
we would get on the average, only
10 per cent. of our orders for vege-
tables of all kinds. yThe goods are go-
ing to bé scarce and the prices are go:
ing to’be very high.” The best crop
is that Of, peas, but only 40 per cent.
of the usual quantity were canned on
account of the extremely hot«spell
which just ag the peas were ready for
cutting. The same circumstances have
made an even more. adverse effect_on
the green beans, only about 12 per cent
of the usual supply of which could be
put up, In regard to the latter wwege-

DON'T MISS THE POINT.

There’ is a men inthis part.of tho
world who répresents, to our way of
thinking, a pretty goodéaverage of hu-
man nature. Whenever the preadclier
in his church delivers a very hot ser-
mon ogainst some special kind of sin,
tiiis man gets enthusiastic and goes
around, to the vestry to téll the’ preach:
er what a fine sermon it was, Then
he goes home and repents {¢ to his
brother, and théy talk over the points
and the people the sermon hit the
hardest. But this particular man nev-
er sees when the sermon hits him. ~~

Early next month the biggest public
campaign ever put on in Ganada will
bo opened to get subscriptions for the
fourth Canadian war loan, the Victory’
Loan. The thing people In this. dia! © <
trict must bear in mind is: ’ That the’
appeals are directed™to each and. ev-
ery one of them. It fs not merely the
well-off men and women who are being
asked to invest, It 1s everybody.The _
ttle sermons which will be “preach. ~~”
