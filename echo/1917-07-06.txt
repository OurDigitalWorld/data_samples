SATISFACTION |

Wherevér you find Ford cars.and Ford service, you find
SATISFIED FORD OWNERS—men who eppreciate the car
for its quick starting, its easy control. its simplicity and
its @xtraordinary capacity for hard! work.

The phenomenally large sale of Ford cara {s the direct
result of Ford SERVICE and Ford SATISFACTION. ;
Fer satisfattion is’ os - universal as the Ford car itself.
Doctors, lswyers, salesmen, bakers, grocers and farmers
all praise the Ford—all are satisfied. 1

Its low cost appeals to them. «Its unusuallyJow upkeep
cost pleases theni, Its sturdy, steady, servicelgiving char-
acter wins them and satisfies them. ~Even :the wealthy
prefer to drive Ford’cars rather than bot) sr with the cost-
ly, cumbérsome limousine and chauffeur. It means econ-
omy when. “saving is a national duty.” :
Ford satisfaction js: just.as valuable as upholstery, or a
fancy finish. Ask any Ford owner about it. H

If yon_intend to buy a Ford, place your order with the
nearest dealer. :

Castoria is a harmless substitute for Castor Oil, Paregoric,
Drops and Soothing Syrups. It is pleasant. It contains
neither Opium, Morphine nor other narcotic substance. Its
age is its guarantee. Jor more than thirty years it has
been in constant use for the relief of Constipation, Flatulency,
Wind Colic and Diarrhoea; allaying Feverishness arising
therefrom, and by regulating the Stomach and Bowels, aids
the assimilation of Food; giving healthy and natural sleep.

AUDITORS’ REPORT

——OF THE—

Town of Amherstburg for 1916.

To the Mayor, Reeve and Members of Council,
Town of Amherstburg,
Amlierstburg, Ont.

Gentlemen,—Under appointment by the Municipal Council of the Town
of Amlierstburg, Y have mad@ an audit of the books and accounts of the Munt-
clpality for the year 1916.

The accounts of Public School Board, High School Board, R. C. Separate
School Board, atid Public Library have been audited for the year 1916. State-
ments of the different School Boards are attached,

Local Improvements.

A statement of advances on different Local Improvements {is shown in
Schedule 10.- No attention has yet been paid to the amount uncollected in
connection with By-law 62-B reported on last year, This. now amounts to
$1,124.91, as shown in Schedule 9. The council should get legal advice and
collect this, or write It off.

The schedules of Local Improvement by-laws are not written up in the

| book provided for that purpose with the exception of the Richmond street

Pavement schedule, which was partly written up by the Clerk while the books
were being audited a year ago. No attempt to write up any of the others
lias been made since :

 

: Water Works.

The accounts of Water and Lighting were all included together In-the
early part of 1916 and have not been separated: Now that the street Hghting
is not done by the town, there is no excuse for not keeping a separate ac-
No entries have been made charging the
town for the use of hydrants and crediting the Water Works.

The Water Works should be charged with all materials and labor expend-
ed and: should’ get crexllt for hydrant rental, free water given by the town to
any public institutions. water used in Town Hall, etc, It is absolutely neces-
sary to keep the accounts in the proper way and make proper returns to the
Bureau of Industries before the town can get its portion of 1915 and 1916
Railway Tax from te Ontario Government, which has -been held back be-
cause the proper retowns have not yet been made,

The water rates are in better shape than ever, the uncollected are less
than at any previous auidit,

By-Laws. : z

Not one by-law pasived In 1916 is recorded in the By-law Book,

The by-law striking: ‘the rates for 1916 is not entered in any book, the
nmounts to be raised for tthe different purposes do not appear in the minutes
of the council, and the by-limw prosented to me is not completed. There are
changes in figures, most off which are in pencil, and it Is not signed “by the
officials.

 

Officers’ Bonds.

Bond of Gordon E, Pullford—$3,000.00 In Canadian Surety Company.

Bond of J: H. Pettypledie, Collector Water Rates—$1,000.00 in Dominion of
Canada G. & Accident Insutrance Company,

Bond of J. H. Pettypieme, Collector of Taxeg—$2,000,00 in London & Lan-
cashire G. and Insurance Ctonipany.

These bonds are in Imperiiil Bank for safe keeping. >

Niew Library.

No action lias been taken om the $212.44 carried over since 1914. The
Secretary of the Library states ithat this was to be taken care of by the
Town, as the first debenture of tthe issue was not sold. The council should
pass a resolution in regard to thiis if the town Is to assume the amount,

Accrounts Payable.

All amounts that could be ascertained-as owing by the town are Included
in Schedule 11 with the exception of an account of Echo Printing Co. for ad-
vertising tax sale-and tax saile commission due the Treasurer.

Rentals.

No rent for scales was ceollected im 1916. Mr. Grant was.seen by the
Reeve and myself, and {s to) pay $28.00 to December 31st, 1916, to the Treas-
urer.

 

 

Taxes.

Tho tax rolls are not completed and’ delivered to the Collector as early
as they should be, causing delay in getting out the notices,

The 1915 tax roll was noit returned to the Treasurer till after May 1st,
1916, the«time on which interrest over 5 per cent, and not exceeding 10 per
cent. can legally be added to ttaxes then unpald,

The council should take acttion at once and see that the 1916 tax roll is
retiirned to the Tréastirer before: May 1st, 1917, otherwise money 1s lost to
the, Cofporation and arrears of tnrxes allowed to Increase.

The council should annuallyy 8 on the settlement of the tax roll. It
this received the ottention it shitould-a number of the taxes in arrears would
then be adjusted’and not allowesd to accumulate from year to year,
5 Atrrears, of Taxes.

The arrears of taxes book written up by me-during the audit a year ago
in which the Treasurer should hvave entered all 1915 taxeg against lands re-
turned unpaid when the foll of 19915 was returned August 14th, 1916, had none
of the 1915 arreara entered by, tite Treasurer. They have now been entered
by mé during titis audit.

Bich ratepayer against Whose land. unpaid 1915 taxes were returned to
the Treasurer should. be nottified that the taxes were returned untollected,
Sec, 119, Chap. 195.°R..S, O). 1914. This was mentioned in my 1915 report
end the Clerk was told about tihis last year, but no atténtion was paid to the
Notice being sents

For some payments of arfreats offtaxes no duplicate receipt appears In the
Treasurer's receipt book pra)vided for that purpose, find some, duplicate re-
celpts that appear are written in pencil. The Treasurer knows that dupli-
cate receipts are required byy'the Act, as he made them in former years,

No date of payment was; mentioned nor does any duplicate receipt ap-
pear to show when some Off the items entered -by the Treasurer in the ar-
rears of tax book were piijd; some of these have not been entered in the
Town Cash Book. All that;'are entered in the Town Cash Book have not been
deposited In’the Bank. Stihedule 16 shows amounts due the Town by the
Treasurer, ,

“Arrears of taxgs are Hajt entered at all onthe current tax rolls, nor do
the Assessors returns in cONjinection with arrears seem to liavé been complied
with. a

 

 

Tax Sale.

Arrears of taxes of the. year 1912 find former years were advertised for
sale, the publication formalities were complied with.

Until I insisted on thjo particulars of each plece of property with descrip
tlon, years of taxes, and {mount beilpg entered in Land Tax Sale Book which
the Treasurer had In hilfg office, no entry at all appeared. in the book.

The Treasurer madj, ga menio on the copy of advertisement in “Gazette”
of land ‘tax sale of paymeéints of taxes on descriptions of property which were
offered for sale and on Whfch he received payment of money, but no copy of
any recelpt appeared in {ihe office of thé Town Treasurer, nor did any entry
appear for any money Trecelved on Tax Sale In the Town Cash Book tilt
entered by me. / Tle MOiney stated to have been,recelved by the, Treasurer
on Tax Sale amounted to 3525.40, Of this $522.70 was deposited In the Im-
perial Bank jn the name of @Grdon E.:Pulford, special. Sec. 225, Chap.: 192;
R. S, O. 1914, requires all 4ccounts of municipal funds to be deposited in the
name of the corporation. !] jad the Treasurer transfer the $522.70 to the
Town of Amherstburg. account in the Imperial Bank. 2

The Act states in R. S. 0.1914, Chap. 195, ‘Sec. 137, that the Treasurer
of every municipality haing poWer to sell land for taxes js required to keep
dupligate blank receipt thook, giving the original-to the person paying taxes
and retaining the duplicaite. ;

There is absolutely Mo excuse for such glaring negligence of duty as has
been shown by yaur TrY#asurer during the year 1916. In®my report dated
March: 11th, 19146. appears; the follbwing paragraph '

“The Clerk and Trésisurer should carefully read the Acts in connection
with Arrears of Taxes beling placed on the Tax Roll, also in connection with
Tax Sale.” 2

It is claimed that for- some of the lands advertised for tax sale receipts
have been produced show'jng that the taxes, for which the land is offered for

‘ Street Lighting System. | :

The street lighting system has heen extended and improved at a cost of
over $3,600.00. I am informed {t was the Intention ‘o spread this expense
over a number of years by issuing debentures, and was not provided for in
the taxes of 1916. 4 < :

If debentures are sold for $3,590.00 the financial position a3 shown in

Conclusion.

With conditions existing a8 has been mentioned above {t. is impossible to
know what moneys have been paid for which receipts have been given with-
out any entry appearing in the books. Some receipts have been produced
showing that taxes were pald on lands for the years for which they are ad-

vestised for sale.
No municipality should permit Its affairs to be conducted in the manner

in which those of the Town of Amherstburg hove been run during the year

1916,
The council should see that all persons against whose lands taxes have

been returned unpaid for 1915 and previous years, are notified without further
delay.

If the Town gave better remuneration for their officials and insisted on
the work being properly performed they would save hundreds of dollars
each year.

I will be pleased to furnish the council further information {In connection
with anything contained in this report, if desired.

Yours’ very truly,

Thore should be a duplicate receipt in the Treasurer's office for all money he
receives from ratepayers. - F

All records available have been checked against the Treasurer's books,
but where no duplicate r pis are kept it is Impossible to tell what receipts
may have been issued by the Treasurer for which no éntries appear in the
Cash. and other books, e. '

Notices have been sent out in duplicate and turned over to the Mayor
to have them delivered or mailed to all ratepayers: against whose property
there js any record of unpald taxes, up to and including the taxes of the year
1916. -The duplicate can be delivered’ by the Assessor unless the taxes are
paid “before that time. The 1916 Tax Roll is still inthe Collector's hands,
Whien it-is returned the Clerk must send the notice to all ratepayors agpinst
whose lands taxés of.1916 are returned unpaid, if atcordance with sub-section
2, section 119, Clitpter 195, R.S.O. 1914. The present Clerk has complied
with this for 1915 taxes.

 

 

Gordon E. Pulford,

My audit report to December 31st, 1916, showed $147.42 due the town from
Gordon EB. Pulford. Since then he has deposited <$87,62 fo apply on above;
but ins not deposited $48.8Sirefeived on April 30th, 1917, from>P. H. ‘A. Davis
in payment of ‘Arrears of Taxes as pér receipt issued op’ that date. He is also
charged with $9.16 of Arrears.of Taxes marked paid but not accounted for.

The attached statement shows Gordon. B. Pulford: owing the Town of
Amherstburg $117.84, made up of cashi received by him and not deposited in
the Bank, amounting to $40.40, and’items marked paid by him in Arrears of
Tix and other books and overpayment to the amount of $77.44. Should any
receipts have been issued for {tems not recorded in the books, any’such items
would have to be added to the $117.84 due the town.

The council have passed an ordér.for salary to.May 15th, 1917, for $20.83,
which sliould apply against the above amount.

There are some commissions due to Gordon’ E, Pulford on items included
in the Tux Saté, which have béén pald and the money deposited in the Bank.
The total amount of commission to th» Treasurer Iincluditig, the excess jof
printing onthe Items paid in connection with Tax Salo is $63.43, This amount
is due Gordon E. Pulford if the Town has to’ gssume the cost of printing in
connection with the Tax Sale,” This fs a miter the council will have to
adjust. : aye

sky Taxes. ne

The 1916 Tax Roll lias not been returned... This should be done Before
the new-roll is placed in the Collector's hands, . ee

There tre some arrears of taxes that should have the attention of the™
council and if they’ are uticollectable, they should be written off so that at
the end of 1917 a proper statement of the arrears.can be made and, tax ar-
rears placed on the 1915 roll ip accordance with the Act.

It would be advisable to clear up some properties irtcluded in the Tax
Sale by the Town buying them In and disposing of them, so as to produco
taxes.

 

 

Scales. .
There {is $28.00 due to December 31st, 1916, for scales, which has not
been collected. +
Licenses.

The Clerk should use the form provided for all licenses and see that the
stub is filled out in every case,
Cash Books.
These have been entered up to June dst, 1917, and the Treasurer instruct-
ed as to’the way they are to be kept. ee

Conclusion. ;
Tho new Clerk and Treasurer lins boen informed that he js at liberty at
any time to write me sliould ho require any information in regard to any
matters In. connection with the Municipality, and he will have a prompt

response. gn
