Two severe elictrical storms put
the Hydro officials toa good deal of
trouble during thé past week and the
one of Thursday night cut the power
off from South Essex institutions all
day Friday. Lightning struck the
wire near the power plam at Sand-
wich, and nearly wrecked the gener-
|ators. It took all day Friday to make
repairs. Early Wednesday morning
lightning struck trees on the route of
the power line, shattering them and
throwing limbs over the wire, cutting

the Hydro Power Commission, went
over the whole line personally with |
|/Manager Debats, and «discovered the
principal.tronble in Colchester South.
| Mr; Jeffrey told The Echo that 90%
of the trouble during storms is due
to the high tension line | running
| through the tops of trees’that have not
| been kept properly trimmed. The

sible to prevent a recurrence of the
+ |troubles. In\the meantime here
quests anyone on the route of the high
tension jine, when knowing of trees
blowing’ across- the ~wire, or other
causes for interruptfon of service to

sent out, promptly to repair the dam-

Richmond street corner with capacity
of 6 by 6% and 6 feet; through this
the cables run, and connections’ were
made here to enable*the Company at
some future time to thke overhead
wires down and extend the under-
ground system. The inside switch
work was done under the supervision
of H. E. Fairbanks, Division Equip-
ment Supt.. of Hamilton, while~ tie
outside cable work was done ~ by
Frank Cross, of Windsor, and the un-
derground work. by Frank W. _Oro}

A Reliable Car
Perhaps the highest. merit in-a motor car is
trustworthiness. And it is with this important

consideration in mind: that we recommend the
Gray-Dort car.

It is powerful—well able to carry you to your
destination without faltering.

It is spéedy—above thé full extent of your

     

L

way motor.

It is comfortable—comfortable in room and in smooth riding,
sprung and cushioned for bad roads as well as good, That. no
other car ofits weight and price is so comfortable, is our beliefs

But above all the Gray-Dort is reliable. Trouble,

to most motcrists, is avoided by a minute and
construction, a high standard of raw materials,

to details,

pies are the things that will eventually win you to the
ort. :

The new Gray-Dort embodies all the good features that won instant suc-
cess: for former models. The 4cylinder motor-is a triumph of smooth,
¢conomical speed and power, The chassis is sturdy and quiet. The springs
are long. The upholstery is deep. The equipment is absolutely complete
from electric starting and lighting to the tools. New lines of beauty have
been given this model.
The five-passenger touring
ts $1,050; the Gray-Dort special, beautifully finished, and swith extra details
<quipment, is $125 above tke list. All prices are f.0.b. Chatham,

bright tobacco of the Virginia type
has, in spite of the unfavorable
wenther conditions of the past’ few
years, made rapid progress on certain
lands of Southern Ontario considered
as insufficiently fertile for the produc-
tion of a normal crop of White Burley.
» These tobacco’ are flue cured in
special barns known as
thorough curing of a crop requiring
from 3% to 6 days according to the
condition of the jeaf when. harvested.

The best. proof of the progress made

nothing special jn the aroma they are
woll suited for blending purposes,
which enables the manufacturer to use
them in coniparatively high. class
cigars, It is not indiacrect to say that
these Canadian fillers are being used

beforé the changes in the tariff, were

kilns, the | being retailed at a price well above

five cents -apiece.

In order to further meet the ~re-
qtiirements of the cigdr industry we
came to the conclusidn that it might
prove feasible to acclimatize in this
country some varieties of tobacco used
especially as fillers.

To this end the Tobacco Division
has, since 1910, been experimenting
with the following varieties: Cuban,
Brazilians, Aurora, Zimmer. Spanish,
Mexican. . Philippines, etc, all of
which are considered as good fillers in

in the handling of this type of tobacco | the countries from which they origin-

is the higher proportion of bright leaf
obtained during. the compnratively dn-
‘favorable season of 1917-1918)" It is
certain that the growers of Essex
and Kent and _ gradually getting
a better idea of the typ@ of soll re-
quired for the production of bright
tobaccos; ag well ay becoming more
familiar with the cultural methods
and the curing process.

The former duty of 28 cents per
pound has greatly helped Canadian
Burleys, but Canadian flue cured to-
baccos, on account of the higher prices
paid for that type of leaf on the Amer-
ican market, were in a somewhat less
favorable position, which is mow great-
ly improved by the.increase in duty
from: 2$ to 40 cents per pound.

The additional protection given the
Canadian leaf can only further develop
the growing of flue cured tobaccos in

Ontario, It is difficult to estimate to

what eXtent at present, but they will
certainly be in much greater demattd
in the near future. There are plenty
of sdils suitable for the growing of
that type of tobacco in the northern
shore of Lakes Brie and Ontario,
where the climate is generally favor- |
able. This is where the industry has

_jsturted and where it wHl probably éx-

pand very soon. .
; Theré™s another type of tobacco

which so far has been very little grown |

in Canada and: for which there will
Iso be a gteat demand, the fire cured
tobacco, whose American prototype is
widely known as Green River.

~Heavier lands than ~ those which
have so far been chosen for thesgrow-
ing of otdinary White Burley*can be

devoted to this type. They cover large |
areas in Southern Ontario in the very ;

centre “of the tobacco growing dis-
tricts, and the farmars, who have made
a specialty.of this” industry. will be
able ‘to devote to the Green River
type soils which have up till now boen
considered as unsuitable for the grow-
ing of tobacco. th
ie fire curing process requires
‘9 practice, but {t is more easily
tered, than the flue curing pro-

ate.
The product which was obtained in

Canada was, in every instance, quite

| aromatic, particularly when the crop
| was produced from directly {mported

seed . It was Important to verify this,
especi@ly as far as the Cubans were
concerned, as it is claimed that the

|aroma of tropical tobaccos degenerate

very rapidly when they are transferred
toa temperate ciimate.

The deterioration of the aroma can-
not take place with filer tobaccos or
the United States such as the Zim-
mer Spanish, the Aurora, and gener-
ally speaking the Ohto and -Pennsyl-
vania fillers. As to the tropical varie-
ties—Cuban, Brazilians, Mexican and
Philippines—the greatest difficulty
encountered was the gcclimatizing of
the typé; or securing a yield per acre
large enough to induce the Canadian
farmers to grow-theni at the prevall-
ing market price. ;

Decided progress his been made In
tat direction, espectally.with the
Qubans. « It is no use trying to pro-
duce these tobaccos fn Canada direct

Some selections "ot Brazijian and

tory, but ontil. now the quantity of
Mexican tobacco™ produced on our
experimental plots has-not been large
enough to allow us, er,the manufac-
{ turers, who have tried“{t, to form a
‘definite opinion of {ts quality.

Two varieties of Philippine tobac-
cos, the Espada and Habana, seem also

very- promising. Some test cigars
made of Espada have proved ‘rather
mild, of agreeable taste, similarto that
‘of good Maniila cigars. The Espada,
however, seems rather difficult to ag-
climatize ip Canada, at Jenst it groat-
‘ly suffered’ in the field from the ad-
/yerse conditions of 1916 and 1917. The
Habana seems to adapt. itself more
readily to the climatic conditions ,of
this country. It yields a leaf a littl
larger-than that of thé®Cuban, of the
same shape, but a llttle thinner. . As
‘forthe Mexican the qu¥ntity of Philip-
pine tobaccos which. We have so far
been, able to handle has been rather
too, small to allow us to express a
} definite opinion as to their merits as
eligar fillérs.

Special attention has been pald to
‘the cigar filllers of Southern Ohio—
Zimmer Spanish, Lottle Dutch and Aur-

‘ora—in order to ascertain how they

would. behave in this country.
The Aurora has produced a_ good
sized leaf, a jittle thick)ywhich has the

to What is known in the trate as clear
Havanas. :

If the growing of ‘tobacco under
shade were to be found practical. in
this country Uie Yamaska would very
probably prove a well sulted variety
for this purpose, at IGast om well as the
selections of Cuban which are used
in Connecticut. While it is admitted
that the Cpbans grown under shade
loge pfactically all their original
aroma, which makes them only valu-
able as cigar wrappers, it is possible
that the Yamaska, not being a tropi-
cal variety, when grown under shade,
would, when grown under _ shade,
maintain more of its characteristics.
That will enable the farmer to make
a ‘better use of his crop.

A variety of Belgian tobacco, the
“Obourg. long leaf’, which has been
known for a number of years in this
country as a pipe tobacco, has
cently been tried as.a cigar filler.

In spite of its special aroma, which
i3 quite distinct from what is usually
looked for in cigar fillera, this var-
lety seems to have some prospects in
this country. It is very thrifty and a
good ylelder, ‘

However, the packers who would
like to handle that Belgian tobacco
should make a careful selection in
order to submit to different processes
the top, the middie and the bottom
leaves. Tho, dromna of the top leaves
is rather strong, too loud and pretty
close to the well known flavor of the
Canadian Canelle. That part of the
chop should be put aside to be used in
aromatic pipe tobacco, But the aroma
of the middle leaves is very nice, and
that part of the crop can cértainly be
used in the manufacture of cigars.
The bottom leaves could be tested by
the process now in use for the prepar-
ation-of stripped fillers- In order ‘to
maintain an aroma of the Canadian
fillers it Will probably be necessary
to ferment them not so energetically
as has often been the case.

Bulk fermentation with two rebulk-
ings for the top, leaves, one for the
middle, jmmediately followed by a
packing into ordinary boxes, when
the leaves are still quite supple, and
of a finishing jn the sweat room, for
about a month; has proved a satisfac-
tory method.” A small lot of Zimmer
Spanish fram the crop of 1917 was
subjected to this process. The rea-
sult was that the top leaves “(rather
thin {t is true) were considered as
ready for. use only four months after
they had been delivered to the ware-
houses. ,

The fandling of the various types
of Canadian tobacco in order to make
them suitable for:cigar purposes is
one of the most important problems,
Canadian tobaccos, owing to the in-
flugnce\of the climate, are’ in a class
by them#elves and little 1s yet known
as to the best way. of treating them
in the warehouses. The Tobaceo Di-
vision is paying a great deal of at-
tention to this question. -

So far the ‘Tobacco Division has
only been able to approach thé Can-
adian ‘manufacturesr who seemed
specially interested in the domestic
leaf. However, it is expected that.a
still greater interest will soon’ be
shown Jn a number ‘of Canadian to-
baccos, ‘the merits “of which are not
yet sufficiently known. Several var-
feties of filler tobaccos will be grown
this year at the Experimental Stations
of St. Jacques |'Achigan and Farn-
ham, Que. While it will take some
time before an opinion can be ex-
pressed on the relative merits of the
finished product, » the manufacturer
who may become Interested, especially
those nea? Montreal, will have plenty
of facilities for seeing in the fleld how
those tobaccos behave in this coun-
rtry.

The season has begun well, under
rather favorable conditions. The sead-
beds have produced a large number of
plants and everything points to a
larger acreage than in 1917.

The high prices paid for the crop of
1917 have induced many farmers to
greatly increase, their tobacco acre-
"age in 1918, However, the Imbor short-
age may prevent them from doing so.
Even; should this problem be solved
fo the satisfaction of the farmer tt
would pe better for him to limit hj ‘
[Self ’to the ‘capacity of his dliring |
barns. Growing more tobacco than
one can safely cure is taking very
serious risk,

It is @xpected that.a cértain number
of manufactufers-who until now have
never tried the Canadian leaf will ex-
periment with it very soon. Perhaps
the Canadian crop of 1918, wapecially
as regards cigar tobaccos, will not be
sufficient to‘meet the requirements of
the trade, at least the Canadian grow-
er should meet his new customers with
cropsbetter cared for than ever. He
should do his best’'to prove to the new
customers, who, he may expect, will
