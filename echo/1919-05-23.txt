The Discrders
in Egypt

Seedpateateeteatoaeateee eed)
OT much more honest nor
prosperous thin the demands
put forth by the Sinn Felners
is the agitation gding on in
Egypt under the standard of Nation-
alism. It is a German scheme, in-

augurated by Count Budow, and
curried out by the ignorant or half

educated Egyptians, the most of
whom have some petty grudge

against the Inws of the land ds ad-
ministered by Great Britain, The
program spread before the Egyptians
by the leaders of the revolutionary
movenient is not unlike (hat prepared
by Lenine and Trotzky. It calls for
the repudiation of the national debt,
practically, all of which is held in
jreat Britain or France, and for the
cancelling of every other sort of in-
debtedneass, public or private, be
tween a native Egyptian and a for

 

 

      
    
  
   
    
 

     
      
    
       
     
   
    
     
     
       
      
    
    
     
    
   
   
   
    
     
    
   
   
    
    
   
   
   
    
     
    
   
     
      
    

 

elgner. This was.something like the
battle cry of Arabi Pasha, whose
desperate revolt was Crushed at

Tel-el-Kebir some thirty odd years
ago, It made a strong appeal to the
most ignorant and vicious of the
people, for they were told that with
the foreign debt repudiated they
would have, practically no taxes,

The cause for {he dfitbreak at the
present time appears to be the great
homeward movericnt of troops who
have been stationed in Europe for
more than four-years. These troops
not only saw stif fighting but were
exposed to climatic conditions with-
out home leave that were most try-
ing, Naturally, as soon as the armis-
tice was signed the Government made
particular efforts to get the Egyptian
army out of the country. In the’ de-
sire to repatriate the men the au-
thorities moved too fast, and the
Nationalists sefzed uponwthe moment
to begin their rising, which up to the
present appears to have been come
posed of scattered murders and mas-
sacres. Advantage Was also taken
of the absence in England of Sir
Reginald Wingate, British High Com-
missloner at Cairo, who wis obliged
to Jeave his post,’ temporarily at
least, because of ill-health, and it
seems not improbable that this con-
dition of his health was reflected in
his administration in the past few
nionths, Otherwise the Nationalist
movement would never have ‘been
permitted to make headway by sc
competent an administrator, His
place is now taken by Gen. Allenby,
and there js no doubt that the rebels
will be dealt with in a manner suf-
ficiently stern.

EUROPEAAN CORN BORER
WORST INSECT ENEMY

‘If the European’ corn borer shon!d
spread to Ohio tho corn>and | truck
crops of the state would suffér tre-
mendously according to J. S. Houser,
of the Department of Entomology at
the Ohio Experiment Station. The
pest has recently been found’ infesting |
apr areayof almow 820 squore miles in
Massachusetts and 400 square miles
an area of almost 320 square-miles in
New York. i |

The, insect ih the adult stage jj, 4
moth which flies from place 46 place
and deposits eggs upon sWeet corn
and field corn, but in addition is
known to attick celery, beans, beets,
oats, polalaes, tomatoes, turnips and
many-of the wild grasses,. The eggs
hatch ifito borers which tunnel through
all parts Of the plants,

“Hecause the moth files the insects
Oh such a diversified range of hosts
fenders jt a much more formidable
insect to control than if it confines its
destruction to but one or-two plants,”
states Houger,

“Becouse’the moth files the insects
spread quickly and easfly but greater
fange riies in the shipment of mater-
{als containing the larvae of the insect
from infested to non infested terri-
tory Particularly celery, Swiss chard,
beets, siring beans, oats, gladiolue and
geraniuin plants.

- “Tt 18 thought that the borer was in-
troducéd {nto -the United States
thréfgh a shipment of raw hemp, con-
Slfmed from Europe to cordage fac-
tories in Massachusetts, where it was
discoVered in 1917. An outbreak
found in January 1919 near Schenec-
tady, New York, is believed to have
been“imported from Austria in bales
cf broom corn,

“Af present there is no simple and
effective control measures known.
Federal control measures will have
some of the borers but a sufficient
number escapes treatment®to nullify,
the final results. Burning infested
crop remains {s effective but must be
absolutley thorough; if. corn alone
were affected the control of the insect
would be easier. It is believed that
Federal cantro] measures will have
to be adopted if an outbreak appears

in Ohio this season. —

LUDENDORFF'S EXCUSES,

Author of the German
Misfortunes,

Quartermaster-General Ludendorft
offers four reasons for Germany’s de-
;feat. These are: “The deficient
| Strategyyof Gen. von Moltke; the de-
| fective direction of Gen, von Falken-
hayn; the poor information supplied
by the German Intelligence Service,
and, particularly, the inability of
Austria to help Germany on account
of the tenacity of the Italian army.”

Ludendorff's analysis js incomplete
and superficial. Von Moltke originat-
ed nothing. His plan of campaign in
France in 1914 was \an inheritance
from Count Schlieffen, his predeces-
sor as chief of the German General
Staff." Von Moltke lost the Battle of
the Marne, But as a result of the
Marne campaign Germany secured
enormous military, advantages, She
came into possession of Belgium and
the richest part of northern France,
For four years she suceeeded in shift-
ing the fighting on the West front
deep into eneniy territory.

The [eal

While von Falkenhayn was Ohiet™

of Staff Germany conquered Poland,
Courland, Lithuania, Serbia, Monte-
negro and Albania. She wrecked the
military power of ‘Russia and set up
German Mitteleuropa, Von Falken-
hayn made @ great error at Verdtn,
yet heleft Germany in a more favor-
able situation than that in which he
found her when he took over the
High Commond.

The German Tatelligence Service
Was poor in a certain senses, But
that was’ only because the General
Staff insisted on Its furnishing in-
formation which would delude the
Kaiser \and the German public, If
the military leadérs were deceived
it was only because they wanted to
deceive themselves. Thére was no bar

to an almost colnplete: knowledge of.

the political and militarysconditions
in all the enemy countrie§,
Austria-Hungary ‘didn’t fail Ger-
many to any crippling extent.. Least
of all did she’ Ml on the Italian
front. The mountain barriers kept
Italy out of Austria. After Russia's
collapse Austria-Hungary could have
spared many. divisions for. German’
use onthe French ‘front if Luden-
dorff had allowed her to remain on
the defensive in Venetia,
Ludendorff evades the real ques-
tion of responsibility for Germany's
defeat. He came into power in the
winter months of 1917, taking auth-
ority out of von Hindenburg’s hands,
although the latter remained titular
Chief of Staff.sHe had to choose.be-
tweon “developing Germany's suc-
cesses in the east and turning weat
again, conquering France and*chal-
lengimg the netitrals by running
amuok with the U-boats.. He favo:
the lotter policy. Thus he made Ger:
man defeat inevitable, Von Moltke’s
and von Falkenhayn’'s mistakes were
trivial compared with his, . He was
the real author of Germany's military

Reon by Metal Expansion.

All metals are imfluenced more or
Tess by changes in temperature, ex-
panding when the temperature rises,
contracting when it fabs, Zinc’ has:
an umisualty high ratte of expansion
| and ‘contraction. A strip:of zine
ary tect long will expand about one
{ evory five degrees the tempera-
ture rises. The expansion and con-
traction of metals is transformed into
motive power|in thermal motors.

In the-therma! clook, described in
“Popular Science Monthly, and invent-
ed by Frederioh Bangerter, & citizen
of Switzevtand, the expansion energy
of sinc is employed for driving a.
clock, and at the sane time the «x-
eees energy produced is stored, to
make it-aveilable for continuing the
movement of the clock mechanism at
other times.

Strips or bars of sine of a total
dength of about 1,000 feet are used
in thig thermal metors The individual
strips are about five feet long and
are arranged to form an articulated
Vhelix. By.an ingenious syntem of.
coil-levers, the effect of the expan-
| ston or contraction of the individual
Strips in compounded so that the
total energy developed is equivalant
to a force capable of 1 a load
of 100 pounds two inches!" This force

WAR MEMORIALS. *

Now that the war is over there is
a desire,on the part of every munici-
pality to commemorate in.some perm-
anent way the spirit of sacrifice that
sent s0 many of our best to France
and who now lie in “Flanders FYelds.”
This is as {t should be, for too much
honof cannot be given to our brave
dead. The question then is as to the
form: the memorials should take. In
the old days théy took the form of
monuments or ma@usoleums, but since
@) new idealism has arisen through
this war in’ which our men have laid
down their lives such memorials are
meaningless. Could our glorious dead
but speak it would be to urge good
works 80 that the lives of the living
may be-midde better for their sacri-
fice.. Works such as hospitals, homes
of the aged, endowed beds, etc., do
\far greater honor than do monuments
and we would urge the councils and
citizens of Canada to so construe the
meaning of memorials.

ae Toronto lady recently reported a
conversation with her boys when she
directed their-attention to the. monu-
ment on University avenue, erected in
memory of soldfers who participated
in the South African War. One of
the boys said: =

“After this big war I bet we will
have @ monument on every corner or
else one whopper.”

I told him we intendéd to honor our
heroes by one “whopper.” It was to
be a memorial Hall, and would cost
many thousands. We would havo
concerts and lectures there.

“Well,” he answered, “I bet their
kids won't have the price of 9 ticket."

motion by Mn Me ‘oig, of Kent, sec-
onded by Frank Glass. of Bast Middje-

should be discussed dt the next meet-
jing of the committee on Wednesday.
Mr. MecCoig pointed out that in one
factory~ in Canada, forty-seven dif-
ferent kinds of wagons were minufac-
tured. He ,further stated that, the
parts of a mower or reaper manufac-
tured during any particular year
would not in many.cases fit the same
make of mower manufactured during
another year, “If both the implements
and parts, wére standardized, the cost
fe the public would be much less.

The heavy blow from the agrtheast
which prevailed on the 9th and 10th
of this month, created havoc among a
large portion of the standing cedars
on Point ‘Pelee, The waves washed
over the low-lying banks and carried
the cedars by the hundreds into the
lake, afterwards to be picked up- by
the current and carried around the
Point. In addition to this many trees
herve been undermined and will no
doubt be carried away by the neat
storm. The wavés algo washed drift-,

were never known-to do before, Old

ONTARIO CREEDS.

What the Boys and Girls of This
Province Are. Thinking. .

Aftor talking with thousands. of
boys and girls. {n rural districts of
‘Ontario, Dr, Creelman has drawn up
a fair representation of
their minds, which he has embodied
in the following Ontario “boys’ and
girls’ creeds:

Boys’ Creed.

1. I believe that life in the country
can be made just as pleasant and pros
fitable' as life in the city.

2, I believe that father and I can

form a partnership that will sult us
both, “ .
3. I believe that if I killvevery weed
on my father’s farm we shall be well
pald by the increased crop alone, to
say nothing of the benefit to our neigh-
bors.

4,1 believe that by careful selection
of our chickens I can double the out-
put of the flock.

5, believe that by introducing alfal- ¢
fh on our farm that we can keep twic6™
as many domestic animals as at pres-
ent.

6. I believe that by keeping twice
as many animals we.will be able to
grow much larger crops of alfalfa and
other things.

7. 1 believe that by planting shade
trees, growing flowers, shrubs, and
keeping a tidy homestead we will be
better contented and happier. in every
way, and our farm will {increase in
value. ;

8. J believe not in lick but in pluck. .

9 I,believe that farming is ® most
honorable calling, and- having decided
to stay on the farm, it is my duty to
make the best use of my time now in __
school, that’ I may be the Better-far-
mer in the days.that-dre to. comé.

10. I believe*in - working when I
work and playing whenal play, and in™
giving and’ receiving a square deal in
every act of life.” 6

Girls’. Creed. -

1, I belleve’that I have a right to
be happy. every day.” 5 ™

2. 1 believe that God's blue sky and
God's green earth are a part of my
inheritance.

Fred. Gardner, a boilermaker, who
addressed the industrial relations
commission at Fort William the other
day, is reported as saying ‘that “in-
crease olf wages was no use. As soon
as Wages rosie, up went the price of
grub, The speculators were watching
wages, and shoving up prices so that
they more than ate up any little in-
crease.” There is the beginning of
wisdom in that statement. Wages are
a large factor In production Gusts, and
when wages are Increased the prices
of commodities are raised accordingly
and the increased wages go po farther
than before in purchasing goois. If
more attention were given to the dis-
covery of economic “le ks,” and to
their stoppage, real progress might be
made in the problem of u

German Guns.

A writer in an English. paper
gracefully deacribingmthe , presenta-
tion of a couple of German guns to
a certain town, dwells, picturesquely
enough, on their introduction to a
couple of older guns, from one of the
old French wars, standing by the
doors of thestown hall. These guns,
he writes, were propably fired last
in 1708, und then, dropping Jiké Mr,
Weeg into history, he speaks of them
as Turenne’s guns. Well, In 1708
“Marlbrook” fought the Battle of
Oudenarde, so that if the guns were
taken then they must have been Ven-
dome's guns.* Of course, they might
have beon Tureene’s first.. But,—
Turenne fell, in 1675, at Sassbach.
A fact which makes the supposition
mildly improbable.

 

Look More Natural.

Behold father and son at the

the photographer, “it would look

on your son’s shoulder.” ; “On the
contrary,” suid. Trotter, “‘to be really
natural, Algy should have his hand
in my pocket!”>

TOBACCO ROT-ROT CONTROL.

 

This {9 a matte that should engage
the attention ind thought of all
tobacco grower, especially. those
growlng White hirley.

The heavy losse: sustained by the
growers in the pa#: demand an hon-
eat effort to controjor, at least, re-
duce the losses fromthis disease to a
minimum through catrol measures.
Due largely to coitinuous cropping

tobacco, ‘together with the trans-
planting of diseased seedlings from
the plant beds, a grea\ deal of land in
the tobacco growing owntres of On-
tarlo has become infestetiwith the dis-
case. Just how long the soll will
maintain the disease ig nd definitely
known, - However, it‘ is afe to say
that such Jands should not be deyoted
to tolacco for five to ten years, much
depending on the degree af ‘infection
and the texture and draimge of the
soil. These infested or sick soils
should be devoted to croys that are
tot hosts of this disease, numely corn,
cereals and grasses, such as timothy
and red top; in fact, almost any crop
except-red clover and other legumes.
These fields should remain in grass
as a meadow and grazing land for
several years, apparently the longer
the Better, to Insure a riddanee of the
diseage,

The growers of White Burley and |
snuff tobacco should practicg at. least
a four-year rotation of crops, tobacco |
being grown onthe same fle ld every
fourth year, There arfebtong indica-
tions that tobacco devoted to the
same fleld.every sixth or eighth would
be much better to hold the disease in
check,

Only thoroughly drainéd solls should
be selected for growing tobacco. Such
solls with a proper hum{e content will
warm up more quickly, thus stimulat-
jhg more rapid plant growth, at the
same time checking the spread of the
disease jn the soil, for it hos been
shown that the root-rot fungus makes
poor growth when a temperature of
80 degrees F. in the soil has been ob-

tained,
Transplant only strong, healthy
seedlings, -Past Observations. have

shown that much of the trouble in the
fleld was due to transplanting diseased
seedlings from the plant beds,

Cool, cloudy weather for several
weeks just after transplanting favors
the spread of the disease on infected
soils, © Such conditions are unfavor-
able for rapid growth of the plants,
which in turn become Infected wind
are rapidly overcome by the disease.
When the crop, in general, {s over-
come by the disease early in the sea
son, no amount of cultivation andl
labor will stimulate the plants to make
Qa paying yield. In order to save a
useless waste of time and labor, the
crop should be ploughed under and the
fleld simmerfallowed ~ and aban to
grain In the fall,

Where the use of “root-rot” dipedsed
soils cannot. be avolded for tobacco |
growing, only “root-rot’ résistant
strains Should be grown. Results have
shown that resistant strains make a
fair.-yleld” on these’ soils where the
nen-résistant strains were,an abso-
ite failure.

From all evidence on hand at the
present time, the growing of resistant
strains together with a. more extensive
practice of crop rotations are the best
methods for checking the losses from
this disease,

For a quarter hour only the crickets
hnd broken’ the silence {tn the,Comp-

ton orchard, where old Toblis and Je-
mima and Minerva, their granddaugh-
ter, assorted some mighty mounds of
fullen winesaps. Then Minerva spoke,

“Zack wants me to run off and mar-

ry? him, grandpappy, after fodder
strippin's over.”

“Lord, Nervy, don't ye!” old To-
bias’ faded eyes were plteously be
seeching. ‘Stay by us, honey. No-

body feels for us old ones Iike you do,
Nervy !”

Minerva smiled faintly. “I told
Zack,i grandpuppy, 1 couldn't marry
him tf mnaowasn't willin’, She'd drive
me off and,surely mistrent you anil
grandmammy if I married agninst her
will.” ‘f

“Was Zachariah fretted?” the grand
mother asked cnoxiouxly. % Minerva
ecrimsoned. They must not know how
much Zack was “fretted!”

“He—he sald he'd stay awny until
I sent for him, I—there’s ma!"

In southern Appalachip {teds custom-

ary-for the nged father and mother to
live with thé youngest son in the old
home, But old Tobias’ log dwellinr
was an unusually large one—a most
desirable home, and Dliza, the wife of
the eldest son, by skillful machina-

tlons contrived

to» get Chuarley, the

Lazy herself, she depended almost
entirely on her young daughter. . her
only child, to do the work of tlre house,
and to keep her services she had de
termined Minerva’ should not warry

any” but some young man she could
take into her house and rule, as she
did Joshua, the girl’s henpecked fa-
ther.

By her orders, Zacharlah Burdén,
who was not the “humble sort” she de-
sired for no son-in-Inw, stayed away
from the Compton house, but Zack
was resourceful’ and managed often
fo see the gentle little creature who
was like n guardian angel to the old
ones,

“Cryin'’, Jemimy?” old Tobias, sitting
smoking on their bedroom hearth that
evening, asked uneasily. Jemima
‘wiped her eyes

“T got to studyin' about Minervy w
waitin’ on her happiness on account
of us and it.worrled me some, Bins!”
she confessed,

After Jemima slept, Bias still sat on
the hearth. Minerva was delicate, like
thelr little Hettle who had diedy six.
tgep Sears befote, three months after
the, sofdler sweetheart -they had not
been willing-for her to marry hnd her:
laid under Cuban palms,

“Little “Hettie! - Littlé: Hettle!" he

her way—I do wish iit, Lord!”

Hispipe clattered on the hearth.
His heavf-groans awakened Jeminia.

"The pain Doc Higgins said was
from my heart, t's pinchin} w little!"
he Jabored out, ‘his hand clutching his
chair rungs, his rugged old face
chalky.

Jémimo trembled as ‘she measured
out ithe drops the young doctor had
left for him. The doctor had warned
her all-worry must be kept from To-
bias, and he*had worried becausé he
had caught her crying about Minerva!

“You. reckon ‘you worked too hard
at the apples, Bias?” she asked him
when at last she got him between. the |
bed covers. :

“No. I got to thinkin’ about our
little Hettle. J was wishin’ 1 could
go back them gixteem years and tell
the little, loviiy thingher and Jess

She pattedhis: jhands in gentle
soothing. “Hettle and Jess wasn't

ain't long off, Bias!”

‘The cireus coming to Caneyyille had
advertised a prize of $10 In gold to
be given to’ the young woman not
afrald and willing to be married on an
elephant’s back in their sing, which
advertisement doubled and tripled the
size of the attending crowd on the
“show day,”

Early that morning Zack Burden's
two mulés passed the Compton wagon,
en route to Caneyville. Zack rode one
mule, Magnolin Rouse the other.
Eliza could not restrain a look of dis-
pleasure,

“Them two are the pair that's to
be married on the elephant’s back!”
old Bilas volunteered cheerfully.
“Zack's done arranged with the show
folks.” |

This news was the last straw.
Eliza turned to her daughter, her fate
white with wrath.

“Neryy Compton, before I'd let
everybody in the county see that low-
down Rouse girl take my feller right
before my eyes, 'd jump in Caney
river!”

Minerva smiled. “Thelr weddin'
Won't discredit me, ma._ Zack's not

he wanted to marry me and you
wouldn’t let him!”

At the close of the cireus perform-
ance, the lurgest and gentlest elephant,
with a howdah on his back, was
brought ‘into the ring.

“Will the gentleman who wishes to
be married please present himself?”
the ringmaster called out,

Zack arose sand took Magnolla’s
arm, but she pulled baek, sereeching
foolishly. “I'm afrald of the eleplinnt!
I'm afraid to get close to the thing!”

“Will the gentleman try to persuade
finother lady then? Were bound to’
have a wedding!” Thebiggest clown
rolled over in a gale pf merriment, but
it was tragedy to Efiza.

Zack looked about him. “I see one
lady I know fs not afraid of the ele-
phant that would maybe marry me,
but she's afraid of her ma!”

Eliza sprang to her feet,

“If you mean Minerva, Zack Burn
den,” ‘she shouted, “she needn't be
afraid of me objectin'! I’ve conclud-
ed I'm perfectly agreeable to her mar-
