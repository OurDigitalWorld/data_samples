“SWHKIT ALL.”

Sir Peter Lely's Brush Makes Her a

Rogue and Enchantress,

Tia new roomful of portraits
which the National Gallery has bor-
rowet from its next-door neighbor,
the National Portrait Gallery, is as-
tonishing in its range, beginning, as
it does, with Henry VII. and ending
with Henry James, Between these
two Henries are some of the most
notable figures {y English history,
both highroad }jistory and by-way;
but no lineaments so remain in my
own mind as those of Nell Gwynn
in Lely’s presentnivat of her.

The overseas soliiers who seem
to be doomed to reiurn home with-
out seeing either the Wallace Col-
lection or the Tate should remember
that the National Gallery, even al-
though half of it is still closed, is
full of interest; As 1 was saying in
the London Daily Express not long
ago, Many of the masterpieces are
now on view, while this new room
constitutes a condensed Valhalla that
should not be missed, For it con-
tains not only some of our best por-
traiture, but our best personages, too,

Lady Jane Grey is here; Henry
VIII, and two of his queens: Cath-
erine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn;
Mary Queen of Scots, Sir Walter
Raleigh and Sir Thomas Gresham;
Queen Mary, when a prineess, with
some miraculously bad spelling

tions that her fame was to be so san-

The Best Styles--

The Best Values-

THE STORY OF
~BOUG CLOTHES —

MONTHS before each new season begins, the orders
for Boug Clothes are placed. The best Clothing Makers
know exactly what we expect-and because our. orders run
into many thousands of dollars these particular Clothing
‘Makers are particular about the way they turn out our
clothes.

The selection of materials is of prime importance.
Only the most.dependable are employed. Tailors who hyave
served for years at their chosen line of work, who are |past
masters at their art, are then given these fabrics and thhey
fashion them into the newest styles, and their workmyan-\
ship must come up to the Boug standard.

Styles for men and young men are carefully studied,
and you may be sure when the finished garments come tb
this store they express the highest types of ready-for~ser-
vice clothes. ts

IN OUR monster showing of Suits every detail has
been painstakingly worked out. The slope of the shojuld-
ers, the cut of the vest, the fit of the trousers around! the
waist, the set of the garment, the linings, the buttonholes,
every minor detail Has been finished under the skilliful
watchfulness of men who know just how suits should be
made, if the suits are to spell coniplete satisfaction for the
men who are to, wear them.

There are conservative styles and the-more snappy
kind for the younger men and the youthful looking Suits
for men who do not wish to show their exact age. Tihere
are Belter models and Waist-line styles, in fact every Inew
tailoring and stylé-idea is expressed in these suiis. There
are patterns for men who prefer the quiet air and the live-
ly patterned suits for the young men who demand this later
kind. You'll find the greatest showing of good suits ever
before assembled on one floor in‘ one store in Western

FIRST PRINTING BY STEAM

Date in’ November, 1814, Is One
Worthy of Remembrance by All
the Civilized World.

The 29th of November, 1814, forms
an Important date ‘In the history of
printing, and consequently in that of
etyitization. It was the day on which
f newspaper was for the first time
printed by steam, instead of manual
power. The common printing press,
though much Improved during the sec
ond half of the last century, could sel-
dom strike off more than 200 or 300
impressions per hour, with one man
to ink*the type and another to work
the press. It was the enterprise of
the London Times that enabled {nvent-
ors to surmount the difficulties of ap-
plying steam to printing presses, In
1803, the edition of 3,000, which was
{ts dally, Issue, took many hours to
strike off. “Thomas Martyn, a cémpos-
{tor ‘on the -paper, produced a model
for n self-acting machine for work-
ing the press, and John Walter, the
proprietor, supplied him-with money
to continue his labors. The press-
men weére hostile .to such innovation,
and Martyn was placed In fear of his
life, and as Walter, did not possess
large, capital, the scheme fell to the
ground.’ As his pecuniary means in-
creased, Walter encouraged invention.
Finally, tn A814. the Koenig patent
was tried secretly for fear of the*press-
men, on the 29th of November, the
night on which. the machine was
brought Into use. It was about str
‘in the morning when Walter went Into
the pressroom and astonished its o¢eu-
pants by. telling‘them that the Times
was alrendy. printed by steam; if they
attempted: ‘violence thereswas a force:
to suppress it; but If they were peace-
able thelr wages should be continued.
Thus was the most hazardous enter-
prise cirried through and printing by.
steam given to the world.

have flowed together at Strasbourg

‘ < HB late Gerge W. E. Russell

A was known in Britain as a
oe : Prince of anecdotists.” In

one book jie recalls the
Duke of Wellington saying that he
had “been much exposed to
authors”; all his long fe Russell
was much exposed {¢ the great men
of a time and society rich in them,
and employed_his opportunity well:
When James Payn was dying he used
to visit him to rélell amusing stories
characteristic of {hose he had met,
and the veteran journalist advised
him to make a book of them. “Col-
lections and Réco|lections,” of 1898,
was followed by i long list of titles.
In his Jast yolume Russell entertain-
ingly proved that he had been ac-
quainted with every Premier since
his uncle, Lord John Russell. Writers

  

of anecdotal memoirs,  autobio-
graphies, and (juries have abounded
in England for long time past.
Poets from Moore to Austin, states-

unen from Greville to Lucy, generals,
journalists, schoolmen, clerics, have
left us long shelves interesting chief-
ly for anecdotes of the personages of
the day, Of those who founded their
fame on Virgilium tantum vidi, none
desenved it mor€ than Russell.

A good story is its own excuse for
being, But one service of writers
like Russell is that they give us an
intimate, informal view of characters
who otherwise would be seen only
as on dress parade. Anecdotists like
J. R. Planche, William Jerdan, Wil-

ONTARIO WOOL CLIP...
IN GOOD CONDITION

 

Very Little Waste In Lots Received
at Grading Station.

 

The wool of this season's clip re-
ceived at*the Guelph Central Grading
station of the Co-operative Wool
Growers’ Association up to the middle
of last week amounted to nearly 100,-
000 pounds, and of 80,000 pounds that
has been graded the wool has proved
up to the following grades Fine med-
ium clothing, 8- per nt; medium
clothing, 3.@ per cent.; fine medium
combing, 3.1. per cent.; medium cloth:
ing. 29.6 per cent.; low medium cloth-
ing, 29.0 per cent.; low combing, 14.9
per cent.; coarse, 13.8 per cent. This
leaves only 5.2 per cent. of the mater-
fal graded in the classes for rejects,
tags and waste, showing that the clip
so far.is in good order and of high
quality, with a good percentage of the
more valuable grades of average do-
mestic wool.

Last year 750,000 pounds of wool
was graded at the Guelph station and

OOD FELLOWS GATHER
‘ AT AMHERSTBURG
y 7. f
Fraternity Exemplifies Four Degrees
Single Day—Largest Gathering in
Western Ontario in Many Years—
Grand Master of Michigan Present

 

Providence smiled on the celebrities
and exemplification of degree work as
the time for opening their Lodge of
Instruction approached on Thursday
aftérngon, and a more Ideal day could
nol have been had by the members of
Rose Lodge No, 28, 1.0,0.F,, for their.
big lodge of instruction, which was at-
tended by Odd Fellows numbering 600
or 700 from all parts of Dssex and
Kent counties,

The roads were only in fair éondl-
lion due to Tuesday's rain, but at noon
automobiles started coming into town
from ‘all directions and there. was a
continuous string’of cars until well
after 8 p.m,

Four degrees In Oddfellowship fra-
ternity were exemplified in the town
hall, the 1.0.0.F. home being far too
small for the work. The Initiatory and
Pirst degrees were conferred by the
|Bssex and Walkerville lodges, re-
spectively during the afternoon, and
both excelled themselyes in the work.
Lunch was served to 600 Odd Fellows
from 5.00 until 10.30 pim. in the I. O.
O. F. hall, which was a monstrous
task, but the members had the volun:
tary assistance of a score of ladles,
jand the wants of the inner man were
duly supplied in as good a manner as
it was possible .under the cfrcum-
stances, and there was very little
cause for compaint.

A large number of the brothers re-
turned to their homes after supper,
but others came to take their places,
and it is conservatively estimated that
when the Windsor degree staff was ex-
emplifying the Second degree, that
there were fully 600 members in the
jhall, which was packed to capacity,
jevery chair being occupi4d. and the
gallery crowded to overflow while
many stood in the main portion of the
hall,

The work of the Windsor second de-
gree staff was impressively dramatized
with special lighting and scenery, and

 

at 9.45 p.m. they gave way to
the third degree staff of the
Leamington Lodge,. who did  them-

selyés proud in upholding their fame,
which fs highly respected and honored
in Odd Fellowship throughout the en-
tire Province,

At the conclusion of the. degree
work, the D. D, G, M. of Reid Dis-
trict No. 1, Eccles J. Gott, who was
Master of Geremonies, introduced for
the first time in an . Amherstburg
lodge of Odd Fellows, George Harland,
Grand Master of the State of Michigan.
The Grand Master of Michigan, at the
very outset of his wonderful address,
won favor with the Canadian broth.
ers in the respect, he paid to the gal+
lantry of Canadian Oddfellowship, {ny
the glory they attained for their coun-
try and fraternity, in the noble stand
they took in the European conflict,
when one man out of every ten be-
longing to the Independent Order of
Odd. Fellows: in the Province of On:
tario responded to the call to uphold
the trad{tions for which they stood as
a fraternity... Had Gérmany been edu-
cated by Oddfellowship, had Oddfel-
lowship gone into Germany and perm-
ented the very soul of the nation@as
it has done in the United States and
Canada, the world would not have
been called upon to face the atrocities
and human sacrifices as had been
done, “An Odd Fellow cannot draw-a
sword ,againsty a brother,” said Mr.
Harland. amid rounds. of «applause.
How many Oddfellows were thare in
Germany at the outbreak of hostill-
tles, asked the speaker, which he ans-
wered by siying less than 7000; while
you in the Provinte of Ontabjo, with
about 1-40 the population of Germany
pessess a menibership of over 50,000.
He characterized the Kaiser, ahd ,his
Potsdam gang as people who~had ev-
erything a heart cOnld honorably de-
sire, but to-day finds him an exe
without a country, ind his dreum, of a
worldwide empire shattered, and his
own ‘people shouting “Down with the
Kaiser.” He pleaded that Oddfellow-
ship might set an example or bind-
ing the peeple of the United States
and Canadavcloser together in the ties
of ,moral consanguinity, and, that no
phrase of {ll feeling will be Used by
an Oddfellow of ejtherF country which
would be detrimental or.ill reflecting
on'the.people or gove
other country. Mr. Harland, ‘though
not a Democrat or in any way a sup-
porter) of. Woodrow Wilson, yet he
stood solidly for the principles of Oda
Fellowship which are involved in the
League of Nations.

“Brothers,” said°Mr: Harland, “there
is anpOdd Fellows wave sweeping the
entire universe, because the-brothers
are becoming more earnest in their
lodge work,.and are throwing “the
goat,” whitch all candidates fear most,
entirely out’of thelr conversations and
lodge, and are pronouncing the fact
that Odd,Fellowship is founded upon
an eternal principle, and that their
guide is the inexhaustless fountain of
God's truth, He closed a most inter-
esting address with the hope that his
next visittto Rose Lodge was not far
distant. A :

At 12.15°a.m. Friday morning;it was
announced that the special cars: which
conveyed ‘the Windsor and. Waiker
ville brothers were ready to leave,
which momentarily disturbed the
gathering while 200 members retired.
The Rey. Mr. Hibbert, .N. G.-of Essex
Lodge, was then introduced in Odd-
fellowshop for the first time ‘in -Am-
herstburg, and delivered an eloquent
and {fstructive address, He was very
well recefyad. 2 oa
Past Grand Master Brett; of Essex,
whom Rose Lodge always claima,
made some nice remarks, followed by
the Daddy of Odd Fellowship in On-)
tarfo, S. McGee, who has been a mem-
ber of the fraternity for 63 years, and
{s still one of the most active members
of Rosé Lodge. Short addresses by
‘Captain Roach, of the Leamington De-
and John A. Auld brought
the reception toa close, and the cur-
tain was drawn on one of the most
successful gatherings of Odd Fellows
ever held in Western Ontario, and the
